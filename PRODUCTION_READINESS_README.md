- Generates detailed recommendations
- Saves comprehensive reports
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 2. Real-time System Health Monitoring
**Location:** `backend/health/system_checks.py`

Comprehensive health monitoring system that provides:
- Real-time system metrics
- Database connectivity monitoring
- Redis health checks
- Celery worker monitoring
- Network connectivity testing
- Resource usage monitoring
- Process health verification
- External service dependency checks

**Features:**
- Continuous monitoring with configurable intervals
- Alert callbacks for critical issues
- Historical health data tracking
- Flask integration for web endpoints
- Export capabilities for external monitoring

### 3. Production Deployment Checklist
**Location:** `docs/production_deployment_checklist.md`

Step-by-step deployment guide covering:
- 27 major sections
- 150+ individual checks
- Pre-deployment verification
- Security and compliance
- Infrastructure setup
- Monitoring configuration
- Launch procedures
- Post-launch optimization

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-production-readiness.txt
```

### 2. Run Production Readiness Check

```bash
# Basic check
python scripts/production_readiness_check.py

# Check with specific output file
python scripts/production_readiness_check.py > readiness_report.txt
```

### 3. Start System Health Monitoring

```bash
# Standalone monitoring
python backend/health/system_checks.py

# Flask integration (if Flask app is running)
# The system will automatically create health endpoints
```

### 4. Review Deployment Checklist

```bash
# Open the checklist in your preferred editor
open docs/production_deployment_checklist.md
```

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Production Readiness Score

- **90-100% (EXCELLENT):** Production ready with minor optimizations
- **80-89% (GOOD):** Production ready with some improvements needed
- **60-79% (FAIR):** Production deployment possible but significant work required
- **0-59% (POOR):** Not ready for production deployment

### Critical Issues

Critical issues **MUST** be resolved before production deployment:
- Database connectivity problems
- Security configuration failures
- Rate limiting misconfigurations
- Health check endpoint failures

### Warnings

Warnings should be addressed but don't block deployment:
- Performance optimizations
- Monitoring improvements
- Backup system enhancements

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for proper functionality:

```bash
# Database
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mingus_prod"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Monitoring
export PROMETHEUS_ENABLED="true"
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"

# Security
export SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
export FLASK_DEBUG="false"
```

### Custom Health Checks

Add custom health checks to the monitoring system:

```python
from backend.health.system_checks import SystemHealthMonitor

monitor = SystemHealthMonitor()

def custom_health_check():
    # Your custom health check logic
    return HealthMetric(
        name="custom_service",
        value="operational",
        status="healthy"
    )

monitor.register_health_check("custom_service", custom_health_check)
```

## üìà Integration with Existing Systems

### Flask Application

The system automatically integrates with your existing Flask app:

```python
from backend.health.system_checks import create_health_routes

# In your Flask app factory
def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Add health monitoring routes
    create_health_routes(app)
    
    return app
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Integrate with your deployment pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Production Readiness Check
  run: |
    python scripts/production_readiness_check.py
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "Production readiness check failed"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Monitoring Systems

Export health data to external monitoring:

```python
# Export health data for Prometheus
health_data = monitor.export_health_data("json")
# Send to your monitoring system
```

## üîç Health Check Endpoints

When integrated with Flask, the system provides these endpoints:

- **`/health/system`** - Current system health status
- **`/health/system/start`** - Start health monitoring (POST)
- **`/health/system/stop`** - Stop health monitoring (POST)
- **`/health/system/export`** - Export health data

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

The system provides real-time metrics for:

- **System Resources:** CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Database Health:** Connection status, pool metrics
- **Redis Health:** Connectivity, memory usage
- **Celery Health:** Worker status, queue health
- **Network Health:** Connectivity, response times
- **Process Health:** Critical process monitoring
- **External Services:** API dependencies

## üö® Alerting

Configure alert callbacks for critical issues:

```python
def alert_callback(health_status):
    if health_status.overall_status == "critical":
        # Send SMS, email, or Slack notification
        send_alert(f"System health critical: {health_status.overall_score}")
    
    # Log recommendations
    for rec in health_status.recommendations:
        logger.warning(f"Recommendation: {rec}")

monitor.add_alert_callback(alert_callback)
```

## üìã Best Practices

### 1. Regular Health Checks
- Run production readiness check before each deployment
- Monitor system health continuously in production
- Set up automated alerts for critical issues

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times and throughput
- Track resource usage trends
- Set up performance alerts

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Monitor authentication failures
- Track rate limit violations
- Monitor suspicious activity patterns

### 4. Backup Verification
- Test backup restoration regularly
- Monitor backup success rates
- Verify backup data integrity

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path configuration
   - Verify import paths in your project

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure database service is running

3. **Redis Connection Issues**
   - Verify Redis service status
   - Check Redis configuration
   - Ensure proper authentication

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify user access rights
   - Ensure proper environment setup

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Or set environment variable
export LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```
