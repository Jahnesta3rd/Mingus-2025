## 🔍 **CRITICAL PARSING ERRORS IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Name Extraction Issues**
**Problem:** The parser consistently fails to extract the correct full name from resumes.

**Examples:**
- Input: "JOHN SMITH" → Extracted: "Software Engineer"
- Input: "MARÍA GONZÁLEZ" → Extracted: "Software Engineer"

**Root Cause:** The name extraction regex patterns are not robust enough to handle various resume formats.

**Impact:** High - This is critical personal information that should be extracted accurately.

### **2. Experience Parsing Quality Issues**
**Problem:** Experience entries are not being parsed correctly, with company and title fields mixed up.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "company": "January 2020 - Presen",
  "title": "t",
  "description": "• Led development of microservices..."
}
```

**Root Cause:** The experience parsing logic doesn't properly handle multi-line entries and date extraction.

**Impact:** High - Work experience is crucial for resume analysis.

### **3. Education Parsing Issues**
**Problem:** Degree information is being truncated or incorrectly parsed.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "degree": "e",
  "institution": "Computer Scienc"
}
```

**Root Cause:** The education parsing regex patterns are not handling the full degree names properly.

**Impact:** Medium - Education information is important but not as critical as experience.

### **4. Skills Over-Parsing**
**Problem:** The skills section is extracting too many items, including full text instead of individual skills.

**Example:** 38 skills extracted from a resume that should have ~10-15 skills.

**Root Cause:** The skills parsing logic is splitting on too many delimiters and not filtering properly.

**Impact:** Medium - Affects data quality but doesn't break functionality.

### **5. Section Detection Issues**
**Problem:** The parser is not correctly identifying section boundaries, leading to data being placed in wrong categories.

**Example:** Personal information appearing in certifications section.

**Root Cause:** The section extraction regex patterns are not comprehensive enough.

**Impact:** High - Affects overall data organization and quality.

## 🛠️ **RECOMMENDED FIXES**

### **Priority 1: Critical Fixes**

#### **1. Fix Name Extraction**
```python
# Current problematic pattern
name_patterns = [
    r'^([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)',
    r'Name:\s*([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)',
    r'Full Name:\s*([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*)'
]

# Recommended improved pattern
name_patterns = [
    r'^([A-Z][A-Z\s]+[A-Z])\s*$',  # All caps names
    r'^([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)\s*$',  # Title case names
    r'Name:\s*([A-Z][A-Z\s]+[A-Z]|[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)',
    r'Full Name:\s*([A-Z][A-Z\s]+[A-Z]|[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)+)'
]
```

#### **2. Fix Experience Parsing**
```python
def _parse_single_experience(self, entry: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Improved experience parsing with better line handling"""
    lines = [line.strip() for line in entry.split('\n') if line.strip()]
    if len(lines) < 2:
        return None
    
    exp_data = {}
    
    # Better title/company extraction
    first_line = lines[0]
    if ' at ' in first_line:
        parts = first_line.split(' at ')
        exp_data['title'] = parts[0].strip()
        exp_data['company'] = parts[1].strip()
    elif ',' in first_line:
        parts = first_line.split(',')
        exp_data['title'] = parts[0].strip()
        exp_data['company'] = parts[1].strip()
    else:
        exp_data['title'] = first_line
        exp_data['company'] = lines[1] if len(lines) > 1 else ""
    
    # Improved date extraction
    for line in lines:
        date_match = re.search(r'(\d{4})\s*[-–]\s*(\d{4}|Present|Current)', line)
        if date_match:
            exp_data['start_date'] = date_match.group(1)
            exp_data['end_date'] = date_match.group(2)
            break
    
    return exp_data
```

#### **3. Fix Education Parsing**
```python
def _parse_single_education(self, entry: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Improved education parsing"""
    lines = [line.strip() for line in entry.split('\n') if line.strip()]
    if len(lines) < 1:
        return None
    
    edu_data = {}
    
    # Better degree and institution extraction
    for line in lines:
        if any(keyword in line.lower() for keyword in ['bachelor', 'master', 'phd', 'degree', 'diploma']):
            edu_data['degree'] = line.strip()
        elif any(keyword in line.lower() for keyword in ['university', 'college', 'institute', 'school']):
            edu_data['institution'] = line.strip()
        elif re.search(r'\d{4}', line):
            edu_data['graduation_date'] = re.search(r'(\d{4})', line).group(1)
    
    return edu_data
```

### **Priority 2: Quality Improvements**

#### **4. Fix Skills Parsing**
```python
def _parse_skills(self, content: str, sections: Dict[str, str]) -> List[str]:
    """Improved skills parsing with better filtering"""
    skills = []
    
    try:
        skills_content = sections.get('skills', content)
        
        # Clean up the content first
        skills_content = re.sub(r'[•\-\*]\s*', '', skills_content)  # Remove bullet points
        skills_content = re.sub(r'\n+', ' ', skills_content)  # Replace newlines with spaces
        
        # Split by common delimiters
        skill_delimiters = [',', ';', '|']
        
        for delimiter in skill_delimiters:
            if delimiter in skills_content:
                skill_list = [skill.strip() for skill in skills_content.split(delimiter) if skill.strip()]
                if len(skill_list) > 1:
                    skills.extend(skill_list)
                    break
        
        # Filter out invalid skills
        valid_skills = []
        for skill in skills:
            skill = skill.strip()
            if (len(skill) > 2 and 
                len(skill) < 50 and 
                not skill.startswith('•') and
                not skill.startswith('-') and
                not skill.startswith('*') and
                not re.match(r'^[A-Z\s]+$', skill)):  # Not all caps
                valid_skills.append(skill)
        
        return valid_skills[:20]  # Limit to 20 skills max
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.errors.append(f"Error parsing skills: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

#### **5. Improve Section Detection**
```python
def _extract_sections(self, content: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Improved section extraction with better patterns"""
    sections = {}
    
    # More comprehensive section headers
    section_patterns = {
        'personal_info': r'(?i)(personal\s+information|about\s+me|profile|contact\s+info)',
        'contact_info': r'(?i)(contact\s+information|contact\s+details|phone|email)',
        'experience': r'(?i)(work\s+experience|professional\s+experience|employment\s+history|experience|career)',
        'education': r'(?i)(education|academic\s+background|qualifications|degrees)',
        'skills': r'(?i)(skills|technical\s+skills|core\s+competencies|technologies)',
        'certifications': r'(?i)(certifications|certificates|licenses|credentials)',
        'projects': r'(?i)(projects|portfolio|key\s+projects|work\s+samples)',
