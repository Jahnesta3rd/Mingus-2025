2. **Update PaymentStatus Enum**
   ```python
   # Add missing status to PaymentStatus enum
   class PaymentStatus(Enum):
       SUCCEEDED = "succeeded"
       REQUIRES_PAYMENT_METHOD = "requires_payment_method"  # Add this
       # ... other statuses
   ```

3. **Improve Mock Configuration**
   ```python
   # Enhance subscription update mocks
   with patch('stripe.Subscription.retrieve') as mock_retrieve:
       # Add proper mock for subscription retrieval
   ```
