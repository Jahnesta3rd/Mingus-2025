    with patch('stripe.PaymentIntent') as mock_payment_intent, \
         patch('stripe.Refund') as mock_refund, \
         patch('stripe.Tax') as mock_tax, \
         patch('stripe.PaymentMethod') as mock_payment_method:
        
        # Mock successful payment intent
        mock_payment_intent.create.return_value = Mock(
            id='pi_test123',
            status='succeeded',
            amount=1500,
            currency='usd',
