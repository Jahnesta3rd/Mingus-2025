## Pricing Structure

### Tier Comparison After Add-on

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Budget** | $15/month | Basic financial wellness only |
| **Budget + Career Transport** | $22/month | Basic + job/commute optimization |
| **Mid-tier** | $35/month | Complete vehicle management + career optimization |
| **Professional** | $100/month | Everything + business/executive features |

### Pricing Rationale
- $7/month add-on to Budget tier ($15 base + $7 = $22 total)
