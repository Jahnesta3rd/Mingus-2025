## Usage Examples

### Creating a User with Referral
```python
from backend.models.referral_models import ReferralSystem

referral_system = ReferralSystem()

# Create user with referral
result = referral_system.create_user(
    user_id="user123",
    email="user@example.com",
    first_name="John",
    last_name="Doe",
    referred_by="referrer456"
)
```

### Checking Feature Access
```python
# Check if user has unlocked job recommendations
access_check = referral_system.check_feature_access("user123", "job_recommendations")

if access_check['unlocked']:
    # User has access, proceed with job recommendations
    pass
else:
    # Redirect to teaser page
    referrals_needed = access_check['referrals_needed']
    print(f"Need {referrals_needed} more referrals")
```

### Processing Job Recommendations
```python
from backend.api.referral_gated_endpoints import process_recommendations

# This endpoint is protected by @require_referral_unlock decorator
response = requests.post('/process-recommendations', 
    headers={'X-User-ID': 'user123', 'X-CSRF-Token': 'test-token'},
    json={
        'current_salary': 75000,
        'target_salary_increase': 0.25,
        'career_field': 'technology',
        'experience_level': 'mid'
    }
)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=your-csrf-secret-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key

# Optional
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=100
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
FLASK_HOST=0.0.0.0
FLASK_PORT=5000
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Database Configuration
The system uses SQLite databases by default:
- `referral_system.db` - Referral system data
- `user_profiles.db` - User profile data (existing)
- `app.db` - Application data (existing)

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- SQLite3
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set environment variables:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
export CSRF_SECRET_KEY="your-csrf-secret-key"
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Considerations
- Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for production
- Implement proper JWT authentication
- Use Redis for rate limiting
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Configure HTTPS and security headers
- Implement proper file storage (AWS S3, etc.)
