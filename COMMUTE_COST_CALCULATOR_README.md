## Cost Calculation Logic

### Fuel Costs
```typescript
const fuelCostPerMile = fuelPrice / vehicle.mpg;
const fuelCost = weeklyDistance * fuelCostPerMile;
```

### Maintenance Costs
Based on vehicle age and mileage:
- **New vehicles (0-5 years)**: $0.08 per mile
- **Mid-age vehicles (5-10 years)**: $0.10 per mile
- **Older vehicles (10+ years)**: $0.15 per mile

### Depreciation
Based on vehicle age:
- **New vehicles (0-5 years)**: 12% per mile
- **Mid-age vehicles (5-10 years)**: 8% per mile
- **Older vehicles (10+ years)**: 5% per mile

### Additional Costs
- **Insurance**: $500/month prorated for commute days
- **Parking**: $15/day (configurable)
- **Tolls**: $0.05/mile (configurable)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Job Recommendation System
The commute calculator integrates with the existing three-tier job recommendation system:

1. **Conservative Tier**: Lower commute costs, established locations
2. **Optimal Tier**: Balanced commute costs with growth potential
3. **Stretch Tier**: Higher commute costs for career advancement

### Vehicle Management
Integrates with the existing vehicle setup system:
- Uses vehicle data from `VehicleSetup.tsx`
- Leverages MSA-based pricing from location intelligence
- Incorporates vehicle maintenance predictions

### Career Planning
Seamlessly integrates with:
- Job recommendation tiers
- Skills gap analysis
- Application strategy planning
- Career advancement potential

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commute Calculation
```typescript
import CommuteCostCalculator from './components/CommuteCostCalculator';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const vehicles = [
    {
      id: 'vehicle_1',
      make: 'Honda',
      model: 'Civic',
      year: 2020,
      mpg: 32,
      fuelType: 'gasoline',
      currentMileage: 25000,
      monthlyMiles: 1200
    }
  ];

  const handleSaveScenario = (scenario) => {
    console.log('Saved scenario:', scenario);
  };

  return (
    <CommuteCostCalculator
      vehicles={vehicles}
      onSaveScenario={handleSaveScenario}
      onLoadScenario={(id) => console.log('Load scenario:', id)}
    />
  );
};
```

### Career Integration
```typescript
import CareerCommuteIntegration from './components/CareerCommuteIntegration';

const CareerPage = () => {
  const jobRecommendations = [
    // Job recommendation data
  ];

  return (
    <CareerCommuteIntegration
      jobRecommendations={jobRecommendations}
      vehicles={vehicles}
      onSaveScenario={handleSaveScenario}
      onLoadScenario={handleLoadScenario}
    />
  );
};
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

### Database Setup
The system uses SQLite for scenario storage:
- `commute_scenarios` table for saved scenarios
- `user_vehicles` table for vehicle data
- Automatic database initialization on first run

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Address autocomplete results cached for 1 hour
- Distance calculations cached for 24 hours
- Vehicle cost calculations cached per session

### API Rate Limits
- Google Maps API: 1000 requests/day (free tier)
- Implemented debouncing for autocomplete (500ms delay)
- Batch processing for multiple calculations

### Mobile Optimization
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for mobile data usage

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Fallback to mock data when APIs are unavailable
- Offline mode with cached calculations
- Clear error messages for user guidance

### Validation
- Address format validation
- Vehicle data validation
- Cost calculation bounds checking

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Public Transit Integration**: Calculate costs for bus/train commutes
- **Rideshare Analysis**: Compare Uber/Lyft costs
- **Carbon Footprint**: Environmental impact calculations
- **Time Value Analysis**: Convert commute time to monetary value
- **Remote Work Impact**: Analyze hybrid work scenarios

### API Improvements
- **Batch Calculations**: Calculate multiple scenarios at once
- **Historical Data**: Track commute cost trends over time
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future commute costs
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with other financial planning tools

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- API usage tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
- User interaction analytics

### Updates
- Regular API key rotation
- Cost calculation algorithm updates
