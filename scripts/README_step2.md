## URL Pattern Analysis

The script analyzes URL patterns to identify content types:

### Article Patterns
- `/article/`, `/post/`, `/blog/`, `/story/`, `/news/`
- `/analysis/`, `/opinion/`, `/commentary/`, `/feature/`
- `/\d{4}/\d{2}/`, `/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/`, `/page/\d+/`

### Product Patterns
- `/product/`, `/shop/`, `/store/`, `/buy/`, `/purchase/`
- `/cart/`, `/checkout/`, `/order/`, `/price/`, `/sale/`
- `/deal/`, `/offer/`, `/discount/`

### Tracking Patterns
- `utm_source=`, `utm_medium=`, `utm_campaign=`, `utm_term=`
- `utm_content=`, `gclid=`, `fbclid=`, `msclkid=`
- `track/`, `pixel/`, `beacon/`, `analytics/`

### Newsletter Patterns
- `/newsletter/`, `/email/`, `/subscribe/`, `/signup/`
- `/optin/`, `/lead/`, `/capture/`, `/form/`

## Recommendation Logic

### Auto-Approve Conditions
1. High quality score (‚â•0.6) AND high/medium cultural relevance
2. High quality score (‚â•0.6) with educational/financial content
3. High cultural relevance with acceptable quality

### Auto-Reject Conditions
1. Suspicious domain with tracking/security concerns
2. Low quality score (‚â§-0.2) with commercial content
3. Excessive tracking parameters or shortened URLs

### Manual Review Conditions
1. Medium quality with unknown cultural relevance
2. High cultural relevance requiring quality verification
3. Mixed indicators requiring human assessment

## Performance Optimization

### Processing Efficiency
- **Small dataset (100 domains)**: 30-60 seconds
- **Medium dataset (500 domains)**: 2-5 minutes
- **Large dataset (1000+ domains)**: 10-30 minutes

### Memory Management
- Efficient data structures for large domain sets
- Streaming analysis for memory-constrained environments
- Caching of analysis results for repeated runs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Step 1 Data
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/raw_urls_complete.csv'
```

**Solution**: 
- Ensure Step 1 has been completed successfully
- Verify all required files exist in the `data/` directory
- Check file permissions and paths

#### 2. Visualization Errors
```
ImportError: No module named 'matplotlib'
```

**Solution**:
- Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements_step2.txt`
- Ensure matplotlib and seaborn are properly installed
- Check Python environment and virtual environment

#### 3. Memory Issues
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array
```

**Solution**:
- Process domains in smaller batches
- Reduce sample URL count for analysis
- Increase system memory or use cloud processing

#### 4. Cultural Relevance Scoring Issues
```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Solution**:
- Check cultural keyword definitions
- Verify domain data integrity
- Review scoring algorithm parameters

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, modify the logging level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Change from INFO to DEBUG
    # ... rest of configuration
)
```

## Integration with Step 3

This script prepares data for Step 3: Domain Approval Interface by providing:

1. **Structured Recommendations**: JSON format with confidence scores
2. **Bulk Action Suggestions**: Efficient processing recommendations
3. **Cultural Relevance Analysis**: Prioritized review queue
4. **Quality Assessment**: Automated filtering criteria
5. **Sample URLs**: Preview content for manual review
6. **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual analysis and reporting

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review the detailed log file: `logs/step2_intelligence.log`
3. Verify Step 1 data files are complete and valid
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
5. Check system resources and memory availability

## Next Steps

After successful analysis:

1. Review `reports/domain_intelligence_dashboard.html` for visual insights
2. Examine `data/domain_recommendations.json` for structured recommendations
3. Use `data/bulk_action_suggestions.json` for efficient processing
