## 1. AI Job Lead Magnet (Intelligent Job Matching System)

### **Purpose**
The AI Job Lead Magnet is designed to find job opportunities that offer 15-45% salary increases while matching users' field expertise and location preferences, specifically targeting African American professionals.

### **Core Algorithm Location**
`backend/ml/models/intelligent_job_matcher.py`

### **Key Calculations**

#### **1.1 Multi-Dimensional Job Scoring System**
```python
overall_score = (
    salary_score * 0.35 +      # 35% weight - Primary importance
    skills_score * 0.25 +      # 25% weight - Skills alignment
    career_score * 0.20 +      # 20% weight - Career progression
    company_score * 0.10 +     # 10% weight - Company quality
    location_score * 0.05 +    # 5% weight - Location fit
    growth_score * 0.05        # 5% weight - Industry alignment
)
```

#### **1.2 Salary Improvement Score Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_salary_improvement_score(self, job: JobPosting, search_params: SearchParameters) -> float:
    # Calculate percentage increase
    salary_increase = (job.salary_range.midpoint - search_params.current_salary) / search_params.current_salary
    
    # Score based on increase percentage
    if salary_increase >= 0.45:  # 45%+ increase
        return 1.0
    elif salary_increase >= 0.35:  # 35%+ increase
        return 0.9
    elif salary_increase >= 0.25:  # 25%+ increase
        return 0.8
    elif salary_increase >= 0.15:  # 15%+ increase
        return 0.7
    elif salary_increase >= 0.10:  # 10%+ increase
        return 0.6
    elif salary_increase >= 0.05:  # 5%+ increase
        return 0.5
    else:
        return 0.3  # Below 5% increase
```

#### **1.3 Target Salary Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_target_salary(self, current_salary: int, resume_analysis: Any) -> int:
    base_multiplier = 1.25  # 25% increase as baseline
    
    # Adjust based on field
    field_multiplier = self.field_salary_multipliers.get(
        resume_analysis.field_analysis.primary_field, 1.0
    )
    
    # Adjust based on experience level
    experience_multiplier = {
        ExperienceLevel.ENTRY: 1.15,
        ExperienceLevel.MID: 1.25,
        ExperienceLevel.SENIOR: 1.35
    }.get(resume_analysis.experience_analysis.level, 1.25)
    
    # Adjust based on leadership potential
    leadership_bonus = 1.0 + (resume_analysis.leadership_potential * 0.1)
    
    target_salary = int(current_salary * base_multiplier * field_multiplier * 
                       experience_multiplier * leadership_bonus)
    
    # Ensure minimum 15% increase
    min_target = int(current_salary * 1.15)
    return max(target_salary, min_target)
```

#### **1.4 Field-Specific Salary Multipliers**
```python
field_salary_multipliers = {
    FieldType.SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT: 1.2,    # 20% premium
    FieldType.DATA_ANALYSIS: 1.1,           # 10% premium
    FieldType.PROJECT_MANAGEMENT: 1.0,      # Base level
    FieldType.MARKETING: 0.95,              # 5% discount
    FieldType.FINANCE: 1.05,                # 5% premium
    FieldType.SALES: 0.9,                   # 10% discount
    FieldType.OPERATIONS: 0.95,             # 5% discount
    FieldType.HR: 0.9                       # 10% discount
}
```

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def _calculate_percentile_cached(self, user_income: int, median: int, mean: int, p25: int, p75: int) -> float:
    # Use simplified normal approximation for speed
    if user_income <= p25:
        return 25.0 * (user_income / p25)
    elif user_income <= median:
        return 25.0 + 25.0 * ((user_income - p25) / (median - p25))
    elif user_income <= p75:
        return 50.0 + 25.0 * ((user_income - median) / (p75 - median))
    else:
        # For high incomes, use log-normal approximation
        return min(99.9, 75.0 + 24.9 * (1 - math.exp(-(user_income - p75) / (mean * 0.5))))
```

#### **2.2 Career Opportunity Score Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_career_opportunity_score(self, comparisons: List[IncomeComparison]) -> float:
    total_opportunity = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for comp in comparisons:
        if comp.income_gap < 0:  # Negative gap = opportunity
            opportunity = abs(comp.income_gap) / comp.median_income * 100
            weight = comp.confidence_level
            total_opportunity += opportunity * weight
            total_weight += weight
    
    return total_opportunity / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

#### **2.3 Income Gap Analysis**
```python
# For each comparison group
income_gap = benchmark_income - user_income
gap_percentage = (income_gap / benchmark_income) * 100

# Example calculation:
# User income: $65,000
# College graduate median: $85,000
# Income gap: $20,000
# Gap percentage: 23.5%
```

#### **2.4 Overall Percentile Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_overall_percentile(self, comparisons: List[IncomeComparison]) -> float:
    # Weighted average of all percentile ranks
    total_weighted_percentile = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for comp in comparisons:
        weight = comp.confidence_level
        total_weighted_percentile += comp.percentile_rank * weight
        total_weight += weight
    
    return total_weighted_percentile / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 50.0
```
