## Database Schema

The seeding script populates the `assessments` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE assessments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    type assessment_type NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    questions_json JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',
    scoring_config JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    version VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT '1.0',
    estimated_duration_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Assessment Types:**
- `ai_job_risk`: AI Job Risk Calculator
- `relationship_impact`: Relationship Impact Calculator
- `tax_impact`: Tax Impact Calculator
- `income_comparison`: Income Comparison Calculator

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8+
2. PostgreSQL database
3. Assessment tables created (migration 016)
4. psycopg2-binary package

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install psycopg2-binary

# 2. Set environment variables
export ENVIRONMENT=development
export DEV_DB_HOST=localhost
export DEV_DB_NAME=mingus_dev
export DEV_DB_USER=mingus_dev_user
export DEV_DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# 3. Run the seeding script
./scripts/run_assessment_seeding.sh
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Production environment with backup
./scripts/run_assessment_seeding.sh -e production -b

# Development with debug logging
./scripts/run_assessment_seeding.sh -e development -l DEBUG

# Force overwrite existing assessments
./scripts/run_assessment_seeding.sh -f
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `development` | Environment name |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level |
| `SKIP_EXISTING` | `true` | Skip existing assessments |
| `BACKUP_BEFORE_SEED` | `false` | Create backup before seeding |
| `VALIDATE_DATA` | `true` | Validate data before insertion |

### Database Configuration
Each environment has its own database configuration:
- **Development**: Local development database
- **Staging**: Staging environment database  
- **Production**: Production environment database
- **Local**: Local PostgreSQL instance

## Verification

After running the seeding script, verify the data:

```sql
-- Check all assessments
SELECT type, title, version, is_active FROM assessments;

-- Check specific assessment details
SELECT 
    type,
    title,
    jsonb_array_length(questions_json) as question_count,
    scoring_config->>'final_risk_formula' as formula
FROM assessments 
WHERE type = 'ai_job_risk';
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive database credentials
2. **No Hardcoded Passwords**: Never commit database passwords to version control
3. **Read-Only Verification**: Use read-only database users for verification queries
4. **Backup Procedures**: Implement proper backup procedures before production seeding

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection Failed**: Check credentials and network connectivity
2. **Table Does Not Exist**: Run migration script first
3. **Permission Denied**: Check database user permissions
4. **Python Dependencies**: Install psycopg2-binary package

### Debug Mode
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
./scripts/run_assessment_seeding.sh
```

## Customization

### Adding New Assessments
1. Create new method in `AssessmentDataSeeder` class
2. Define questions and scoring configuration
3. Add to `seed_all_assessments()` method
4. Update assessment type enum in database

### Modifying Existing Assessments
1. Update question structure in seeding method
2. Increment version number
3. Run with `SKIP_EXISTING=false`
