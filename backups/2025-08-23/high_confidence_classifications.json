Once you cross the 5 million mark, it is classified in the luxury territory, even for cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to calculate the minimum income necessary to own a five million dollar house. For background, Ive owned real estate in San Francisco since 2003. I also own a house thats worth more than 5 million after purchasing a new forever home in 2023 when mortgage rates were high and demand was low. Real estate accounts for about 50 of my net worth and about 65 of my passive investment income of 300,000 a year. Im actively investing in private real estate through Fundrise, my favorite private real estate platform. Whats great is you can get started investing in real estate with just 10. I started Financial Samurai in 2009 while working in finance. The site is now the top independently-owned personal finance site in the world with over 1 million organic visitors a month. Minimum Income Necessary To Afford A 5 Million House When it comes to buying a home, a good rule of thumb is to spend no more than 3X your gross income on the price of a home house. It is part of my 30303 rule for home buying to help people buy responsibly. In other words, if you want to buy a five million dollar house, then you should earn about 1.67 million a year. In addition, you should have at least a 1,000,000 down payment and ideally another 500,000 buffer in the form of cash or liquid securities. The buffer is just in case you lose your job or something bad happens to your house. Does needing a 1.67 million income to buy a 5 million home sound like too high a hurdle? After all, once you make over 1 million a year, you have a lot more disposable income. Just know that in the past, people would buy their homes with all cash. So the minimum income to buy a 5 million home also depends on your net worth and cash balance. I understand very few people can afford to buy a 5 million home. But its always fun to dream as home prices get higher and higher over time. Further, its always good to plan ahead. For those of you who currently own a 1-3 million dollar home, 5 million may be the next step if so desired. How To Afford A 5 Million House As I just calculated, having a 1.67 million annual income to afford a 5 million house is recommended. However, in this permanently low interest rate environment, you can stretch to buy a home up to 5X your annual gross income. In other words, you can make as little as 1,000,000 a year, to buy a 5 million home. Your minimum income should also be consistent over the next several years. However, without a large cash buffer, you will feel stressed and a little paranoid during the initial years of ownership. Having a 4 million mortgage after putting 1 million down is a lot. At a 3 mortgage rate, were talking a monthly payment of 16,864. Thats 202,368 in yearly mortgage payments, before paying taxes. But people who buy five million dollar houses generally put way more down than just 20. Further, mortgage rates are closer to 5 now after the pandemic. If you pay a total effective tax rate of 32, then you would need to earn 297,600 in gross income just to pay 202,368 a year in mortgage payments. Then, of course, youve got to pay for everything else in life. Put Down More Than 20 If You Want To Buy A 5 Million House If you plan on buying a 5 million home, you probably want to put down a greater down payment percentage. For example, a 2 million mortgage after putting 3 million down is only 8,432 a month at a 3 interest rate. Thats only about 10 of your monthly 83,333 gross income figure if you make 1,000,000 a year. The people I know buying 5 million homes and up are often putting down 40  100. Further, most people I know who make over 1 million a year dont have a 1 million base salary. Instead, their base salaries are much lower, more in the 200,000  500,000 range. The rest of their compensation comes in the form of stock grants and year-end bonuses. When I was working in banking, an Executive Director had a base salary of 250,000. An EDs year-end bonus could range from 0  200 of base salary. Depending on the size of the bonus, a portion of it would be in deferred stock and cash compensation over three years. The greater your bonus, the larger percentage of the bonus was deferred. The Cost To Own A Five Million Dollar Home When you own a 5 million house, remember that your homeownership costs will be magnified as well. Were talking 60,000  150,000 a year in property taxes alone, depending on the property tax rate by state. Hawaii has the lowest property tax rates while Illinois, New Jersey, and Texas have the highest property tax rates. To maintain a 5 million home, there are also higher heating bills during the winter, higher homeowners insurance, higher maintenance costs, higher cleaning costs, higher landscaping costs, a bigger mortgage, and so on. If youve got a leak in your roof, like I had during our Bomb Cyclone, it becomes much harder to find! Therefore, dont think about the cost of a five million dollar house as just the initial purchase price. Think about the ongoing cost to maintain a five million dollar house. Then there is the cost to furnish a larger home. The opportunity cost of owning a 5 million home is also the cost of not renting it out. Deferred Maintenance Expenses Can Add Up In A 5 Million House One of the reasons why I sold my old house in 2017 was because it had four bedrooms and three bathrooms for just my wife and me. The market rent was between 7,500  8,500 a month at the time, which we werent willing to pay. Further, there were between 50,000  85,000 in upcoming maintenance issues we may have needed to do. These included: Rewiring the entire house from knob and tube to ROMEX wiring: 50,000 Replacing windows in the back of the house and waterproofing, which the new buyers did: 35,000 The property taxes and recurring maintenance are the main reasons why buying an expensive house can be a bummer. The more you have, the more you have that can go wrong. A smaller, more manageable house is often the way to go for those who want to achieve financial freedom sooner. Minimum Income Necessary To Afford A 5 Million House The absolute minimum income necessary to afford a five million dollar house is 1 million. The recommended income for owning a five million dollar house is 1.67 million. An acceptable income to own a five million dollar house is 1,250,000. In other words, the multiple of",
