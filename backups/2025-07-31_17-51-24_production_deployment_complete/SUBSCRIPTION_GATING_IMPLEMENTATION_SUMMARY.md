if (!hasAccess) {
    // Middleware will show appropriate modal
    return;
}

// Proceed with feature implementation
const result = await generateAIInsights();

// Graceful degradation

    'ai_insights',
    async () => await generateAIInsights(),
    async () => await showBasicCalculator()
);

// Start trial
