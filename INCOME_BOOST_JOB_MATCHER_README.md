```

- Mock tests for external API calls
- Database operation tests
- Scoring system validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Job Board API Keys
INDEED_API_KEY=your_indeed_api_key
LINKEDIN_API_KEY=your_linkedin_api_key
GLASSDOOR_API_KEY=your_glassdoor_api_key
CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY=your_crunchbase_api_key

# Database Configuration
JOB_MATCHING_DB_PATH=backend/job_matching.db

# API Rate Limits
INDEED_RATE_LIMIT=60
LINKEDIN_RATE_LIMIT=30
GLASSDOOR_RATE_LIMIT=20
```

### MSA Configuration
The system is pre-configured with the top 10 metro areas for African American professionals. You can modify the `target_msas` list in the `IncomeBoostJobMatcher` class to add or remove metro areas.

### Salary Multipliers
Location-based salary multipliers are configured for major metro areas. These can be adjusted in the `msa_salary_multipliers` dictionary.

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexing
```sql
-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_job_field ON job_opportunities(field);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_score ON job_opportunities(overall_score);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_salary ON job_opportunities(salary_median);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_remote ON job_opportunities(remote_friendly);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_company ON job_opportunities(company);
CREATE INDEX idx_company_name ON company_profiles(name);
```

### Caching
- Company profiles are cached in the database
- Search results can be cached for repeated queries
- API responses are cached to reduce external calls

### Rate Limiting
- Each job board API has configurable rate limits
- Requests are queued and throttled appropriately
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Job search success rate
- Average salary increase achieved
- Company diversity scores
- Remote job percentage
- Search performance metrics

### Analytics Endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/job-matching/analytics
```

Returns:
- Field distribution
- Average scores by field
- Top companies by job count
- Remote job percentage
- Total jobs processed

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use secure key management services in production
- Rotate keys regularly

### Data Privacy
- No personal information is stored
- Job data is anonymized
- Company data is publicly available information only

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Monitor for abuse and suspicious activity
- Use CAPTCHA for high-volume requests
