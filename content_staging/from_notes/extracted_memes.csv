15545_5115,One of the biggest things that we have to deal wit...,"One of the biggest things that we have to deal with is the skills and credentials dilemma for sometime in America and especially in our community getting credentials, was always the thing that 00:17 I had to do people always told you that you had to go off and go to college or go to grad school or get a professional degree or something along those lines in order to get ahead which changed over the past 1520 years 00:32 That with the advent and the rise of technology, a credential doesn't do nearly as much for you as your ability to be able to solve problems and part of the way that you solve problems is often going to be using technology 00:48 Now everybody doesn't have to be an engineer or scientist or really know how to do calculus and all these complex things at first however, you do have to learn how to solve the problems and 01:02 That means skills are becoming more important than a credential and you can see that across the board now what winds up happening is if you get skills, you can solve problems that'll help you make money, but it won't 01:17 Sarah Lee always put you in a position to work in a corporation, which is part of the safety net for lack of better description and a lot of people are experiencing that cushion of knowing that you have a a big corporation behind 01:32 Gives you a lot of security, but what we're finding out is that a lot of that security really easily even there and you know we won't get into that here but the big thing is that you have to learn and develop skills that solve problems that people need 01:47 To be solved and a lot of that's gonna come from really buckling down and learning who you are and learning what really motivates you and learning what you're good at to get to those skill points now you can do the technical route for sure 02:02 A lot of that you can learn online and when you learn it online, which you can then do is find people that are closest to you where you can put those skills to work and do it for others whether it's a church, social organization whatever it may be it'll help you get better 02:17 And then, as you get better that you can charge more and make more money so that's one of the things one of the great things about where we are right now in this world is that the technologies, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence gives you 02:32 All the tools that you need so that you can figure out how to solve the problems and I'll go through some of that later and give you an outline on that but you don't have to know how to program and write the code anymore. What you do. 02:47 Need to figure out is all the steps that she would need to take in order to solve the problem and ask and learn how to ask questions and write out steps in order for the AI to build it for you, but you don't necessarily have to know how to do it 03:02 My hand by yourself anymore those days are kind of over now which you have to do is how you actually go step-by-step to solve the problem and then ask the computer technology to do it for you and then learn how to troubleshoot 03:17 Not working that's the big thing that'll be you know very present and impression for people to do going forward so that part of getting credentials not so much anymore. You know back you know when I was coming up to give you 03:32 Story you had to go back to grad school and had to go to one of the top five grad schools to get an NBA from where the top 10 in order to make the real money that everybody was making, but what you learned from overtime from those people that did that is that would 03:47 He kept them there and helped them accelerate was the skills that they picked up while they were working in these rules, learning how to solve problems learning how to present information learning how to tell a story with data. Those are the things that really propelled them forward. 04:02 More so than the credential itself, the credential itself is nowhere near as important as it used to be the skills that you pick up and gaining the credential that you can do on your own now with a much lower price tag than having to go pay 04:17 Grand or 50 grand to go to grad school is where it's at and that's what you gotta focus on and we can talk more and we'll give you some concrete steps how to explore that but one of the things that you learn from using the app is that we kind of show 04:32 Hey, here's an income gap. Here's if you picked up the skills where you can pick up that money that you're missing because you don't know how to do certain things and then that is what helps propel you forward to solve some of the monetary problems that you're dealing with and that you have. 04:47 And that's the big thing that you have to work out for and work on and we're gonna help you do that 00:04 One of the next big things that always comes up when you're thinking about growing and pushing your career forward and learning new skills and everything else really comes down to one of the big questions is working 00:18 And mentorship 00:21 Those are can be really touchy subjects and a lot of ways but you always need a mentor or someone who's been down the path that you're trying to go down to give you some insights often 00:35 Times people lean on the mentorship aspect of a way more than they should so you'll seek out someone and you try to get some big name or your bosses boss you know to become like this year 00:51 Often times you run the brick walls because of it I think one of the more important things that you can do is one find someone on one level above you that may not work in your company you or 01:05 The lake that you can talk to about what you're facing and what you're trying to do 01:11 After you do that, the biggest thing I think you could do when it comes to finding mentors and networking is actually getting out there and doing stuff I think 01:20 Too often you know, some people will take the route of well my mentor is gonna help me out with this and help me introduce me to people and often times people don't even have the time to do that for themselves let alone for others so that's a whole separate issue but 01:36 But you really need to really focus on is being in service to others that allows you to use the skills that you're trying to demonstrate a learn and controlled ways and environment and what I mean by that 01:50 That is simply this if you're trying to learn how to build a business when it comes to creating apps or you learning how to build a business when it comes to having a salon or something like that, you need to find somebody that has a salon 02:06 And then you can usually find that through your own personal connections in your immediate family you know or immediate extended family I can help you out and introduce you to someone and then from there it's trying to be a service to that person 02:20 I'm trying to learn about this. I really like what you're doing. I wanna learn more about it. I don't know how to build a map in a path, but I want to talk to you about it, but how can I help you at being a service to someone and with whatever. 02:35 Skill that you have now was one of the more important things you can do to build a network or find a mentor and once you do that that person more than likely be like oh this person was really helpful. I haven't. I know somebody else is having this issue and they'll point you in their direction. 02:50 You can work on something for them, but more often than that you're gonna be working for somewhat doing something for them more than likely he won't be getting paid for free or getting paid at all to do it but in being a service to someone more than like 03:06 I said eight times out of 10 it's gonna lead to something else so it's gonna lead you to another step in your progression of where you're trying to get to and what you're trying to become. I can't emphasize the service aspect enough either. You can do it. 03:20 Fraternity sorority, church, organization, kids organization somewhere along the line and being of help to someone else is going to provide you with the next stepping stone. It's gonna get you closer to where you're trying to go because just saying hey. 03:35 I want you to be my mentor isn't gonna do anything for them in a certain I gotta do anything for you because more than likely people gonna think you're just gonna take for them, but if you are offering something to them being of service helping them with some problem that they have and 03:50 Can't do directly say I know somebody is good at that. Let me put you in touch with them and facilitate that introduction. Then you're kind of helping them in an even greater amount of manner than you ever thought you would because you're showing them I can provide value in another way. 04:06 My own network of people that they might not know so being of service is the key thing to finding a mentor and building a network and as you build that out and you've got those contacts in your phone of people that you help 04:21 Chances are they're gonna lead you to something that's gonna be much greater value down the road than what you're dealing with and you're working with now and that's how you pick up what you need to know 00:02 The whole concept of side hustles, and what they can do for you 00:09 Has become a complete phenomenon I mean previously you'd work on something or you work someplace and maybe it was bacon cakes on the side you make a couple hundred dollars something 00:25 But nowadays, a lot of people are making some serious cash doing things on the side, so it's always one of those viable things to do when you have a certain skill set 00:40 And you can charge for it and you can manage your time often though the side hustles become just another job that's frustrating and you don't never you can't ever really take off with it now 00:54 How you know were there a side hustle is actually gonna turn into something long-term for a business that you can really grow in nurture that better aligns with what you wanna do with your life takes time and it takes experiment 01:10 And most people don't have that cause most people are doing the side hustle to fill in a gap and the income that they need in order to do something that they need to do which is fine so you know for some people that you know DoorDash, Uber 01:24 Bring whatever it may be because that helps them make extra cash to cover their basic expenses, but it doesn't always lead to you becoming an entrepreneur and building your own business building. Your own business is really tough but it's definitely. 01:40 Side hustle can take you and start you on that journey more often than not it'll show you what you don't need to do and the things that you shouldn't do so that you don't make those mistakes over and over and over again 01:55 But it's not the big you know thing that's actually gonna make you blow up like you want to. I think if you grab the skills that people are in going to pay for and are in demand. 02:09 Turn into a lucrative business for you overtime, but it doesn't happen immediately so like we were talking before when you can build up a skill set of organizing programming marketing 02:25 Helping people that don't have a certain skill, but wanna do something that you're good at and showing them how to do it you can build that into a good business for yourself but often times it turns into another job versus hey 02:39 Got this whole new enterprise is paying me hundreds of thousand dollars a year that doesn't necessarily happen automatically but doing something on the side can be that hobby that then turns into a business that give you 02:55 20 grand a year that's that's nothing to shake that you can put that away salt that away. It's 7% annual that compounds into something really big so I think the bigger thing to really focus on it isn't that the hustle turned you into an entrepreneur but 03:09 I also so does more than fill in a hole in your budget and helps you actually grow your money because you throw the money that you make from your side hustle into an investment account that grows faster than you know what you'd be able to do if you just had 03:25 Regular income, I think that's the more important thing to focus on and I think a byproduct of that will be that as you do this thing on the side, you'll learn as you talk to different people that are asking you for your service 03:40 That hey there really is more demand than I thought and then you can build something even faster and vacuum, you can invest the cash in that eventually may turn into a salary now what I've been told 03:55 But others have done this before is that hey you need to give yourself time in order to do it so before you try to move from your side hustle to being a mainline entrepreneur you should at least be able to do this for 12 months and make money and that amount of money 04:09 That you make should buy your runway from you working your regular job as well so that becomes two incomes and once you save that up over a couple of years of doing your side also then you might have runway in order to build it up 04:25 That's actually a company versus just being a hobby that just happens to make you money. I don't think you really go out and strike out on your own until you have enough covered in your basic cash account for at least a year in order for you to really make. 04:39 Change because it's gonna be harder than you think it's gonna take longer than you think and that's what really people had to build stuff overnight. That's really gonna respond and turn into this new career that you can pray to your friends about that. You don't have to work for anybody any longer. 04:55 All those things can't be done, but it takes a little bit longer than you think. I'm turning that side hustle into your entrepreneurial dream that can sustain you and is especially true. If you have other people that depended on you like kids, you know wives 05:09 It may be so take that in consideration, but I think you what you should do is work on it for a year or two save up enough money from actually doing that activity after a year or two and then you'll know hey like I can really turn this into something because 05:24 You'll be able to devote full-time effort to that so that you could eventually make it grow and turn it into your vision of you know your future that you wanna have for yourself 00:01 The next thing we really need to talk about that plagues a lot of people that I consider the underdog of this whole concept of fear and posture syndrome and being 00:15 Worthy often times we look in the rearview mirror about what we used to be or what we think of ourselves as a projection into the future of what we can become and it's a big mistake I think 00:30 That the way to overcome that mistake of thinking about that way really comes from the life philosophy things that we talked about at the beginning of this book really being grounded and the creators plan for you because he does have a plan 00:45 And keeping yourself focused on that fact that he does have a plan will take some of that unworthiness in that spirit field this out of you 00:58 I had a good friend of mine when I was in grad school, who went through this rigorous in a military training program and he said he said one of the instructors in the program told him that people who were 01:14 Worse off and less physically gifted than you finished this program and I think you have to take that mindset into whatever it is that you do you have to know and think of every little step that you're taking 01:28 And you're making that is turning into something is going to help you into the future of becoming the person that you need to become in order to hold that role and feeling unworthy is just natural like you know I'm not 01:43 Smart enough or you look at all the mistakes that you've made, but I think the other thing to really focus on is to do focus on the things that you have done and accomplished that will be the building blocks of you stepping onto those things that'll get you to those higher level 01:58 So I think that when you think of it and say well for me when I transition from being an engineer to work in finance, I really felt that I was just completely lost 02:13 Mean I was sitting on the trading floor still working through definitions and writing things down trying to make sure I can keep things straight and it was overwhelming. I mean it was a completely new language in a completely new environment doing things. 02:28 Done before and having to do it immediately on the fly and if it was wrong, you know people would you would get this impression and feel like all people think I'm stupid. It was nerve-racking and what I finally learn. 02:43 To do was just let go of it all and the way I did that was just saying you know what I was brought here for a purpose, lesser people than me have made it through here and I'm gonna do it too and I just buckle down and just pay attention and ask questions and just 02:58 The day by day and as you do it day by day, you become more comfortable in that environment, other people around you see you becoming more comfortable in environment, and the anxiety slowly phased to the background it doesn't completely go away 03:13 Until years later after you've been doing it for sometime and for me, it took a good three years before I finally felt comfortable in environment, but I was doing little things along the way that we're helping me to feel more comfortable 03:28 Be able to have the discussions they talk about the math about stuff and relate to the clients and all those things doing that little by little helped me a lot and you have to focus on just that day not pay if I don't do this by this date it's gonna blow up on me or I'm gonna make. I'm gonna get fired. 03:43 I'm gonna be out of work just focus on the day and just focusing on the task and hand the things that you need to learn at that moment get rid of that fear factor of you know you being found out or you know people finding out that you're really not cut out for all this all that 03:58 Soft talk, get drowned out by you focusing on the creators role and what the purpose that he's giving you to be in opposition, he wouldn't put you in that position if he didn't really think that you should be there and if you were there 04:13 Close the door so that would never gotten there so when you focus on that kind of thought process and really come back to that every time and learn how to calm yourself you'll be able to get through it all, and that imposter syndrome will fade. It will go away and you wont. 04:28 To worry about it nearly as much overtime because you become really competent first then you're really become good and once you become good being great just means more and more repetitions and practice on focusing on the little things and before you know it you're set 00:02 What are the ways you actually can measure whether your skill development is really paying off financially is two things one looking at the feedback you're getting from your boss 00:15 About what you're working on now too the next thing to book for is when you're going out for interviews or you're trying to get traction on this new role 00:27 And you submit an application or resume if you actually get an 00:32 If you can get an interview that tells you that you're getting closer to having the skill set that you'll need for that particular role and it'll take a lot of application sometimes do that but that's one of the big indicators that tells you that OK I'm getting 00:47 And usually once you kind of figure out what that next role is six months into what you're doing now after you started doing your daily practice, looking at courses 01:02 Online trying to build up the skills on your own start applying for jobs. Nothing ever hurts you from actually putting in an application for a role on indeed or LinkedIn or any of those places. 01:17 Three application in there do the easy apply and if you start getting people to kind of contact you and setting up an interview or two, then you know OK I'm kinda on the path that's one of the big indicators and then what usually happens after 01:32 Interviewed a couple of three times and you haven't gotten something that's not unusual so don't get discouraged instead you just know OK I'm gonna have to crack a few more eggs along the way in order to make this omelette to make it all come together, but you're on the path and that's usually one of the big 01:47 Indicators that you'll get now let's say you've gotten a few interviews to get through a couple of three rounds. You become a finalist and behold you're gonna get a offer and when you get that offer which you usually gonna find out is that it's usually between a 15. 02:02 20% bump from where you were before into this new role that is when you know you're on a on the path and that is how you're going to know that this whole technique in this whole way of going about things works in one 02:17 Things you can't get discouraged about it. You gotta put in a lot of applications. You're gonna talk to a lot of people you're gonna work a lot of time but usually it's about a 12 month process to get you to you're really in the groove and you're ready to make that next step. 02:32 It doesn't take 24 months usually within a year if you've really been working and grinding away on it, but usually within 12 months of you getting on this plan and starting to think about OK, I need to pick up how to use the software I need to pick up how to you know be able to do present 02:47 Patience in a certain way, but you know how I need to be able to repair something a different way whatever it may be learn how to troubleshoot better all these things come together and then boom it'll happen and that's the process of becoming that new person that holds that role 03:04 Often times we get 03:08 Just we just get so distracted because we think it's just gonna happen pretty quickly or you're gonna get a couple bites of the apple and boom it just happens more more often than that. It's a slow grinding process, but 03:22 This is what's really getting you prepared for this next thing as you go through a time and time again you work on these things you'll get discouraged that's natural but soon as you get discouraged take a deep breath take a break. Come back a couple days and get right back. 03:37 Because you can't afford to let these distractions in this being discouraged prevent you from getting where you need to be because you got people that depended on you and most of times you don't think of it that way you think of it it's just failure thing and you start getting into that negative thought process 03:52 Yes, but that's where you fall back to what we started all of this out with when it comes to faith the faith that your creator is putting you on this path because he's preparing you because he's got something great in store for you if you just keep listening to him 04:07 You know there's a lot of different stores that you can go into about people you know really walking by faith but I'm telling you it all works and quite literally you gotta imagine like you know the story of the Hebrews in the Bible 04:22 I during the day they followed this pillar of smoke at night. They followed this pillar of fire that got them where to go. You literally got a vision that happening for you as you go through this process and I can't tell you how quickly it'll happen to you, but what? 04:37 Can't tell you once you start visualizing that that remind you that OK I'm on this path. He hasn't gotten me this far. I'm going on the new and better things and it'll get you there and that's how you really gonna know and you'll start getting nibbles and bites as you. 04:52 On the lower levels from associate to manager and things like that, it happens a lot quicker when you're trying to make these big jumps from like director to VP you know even higher levels to the SVP in the EVP levels. It takes much longer, but. 05:07 We're just talking about getting you up the hill and getting you started and getting you going and I'm telling you it all pans out and that's the way you look at it 05:16 Another thing to really keep in mind is the interactions you have you know 05:22 Often times they're like associations and different networking events that you go to occasionally, you pop in there and meet a few people get cars and again I can't stress this enough learn how to be of service to other people hey 05:37 This bubble will block you're working on this at this company. You know you're just talking about it. I'd love to help you out with this. This is what I can do in that area. If you need some help with you know XYZ let me know I'd be more than you know be able to put some time in for you 05:52 What I can do for you and just leave it at that people will take advantage of that and in the process you'll learn you'll grow and you'll become a useful person in that person's network so that when something pops up, they'll remember you'd be like hey, I met this kid that did 06:07 For me or my business, you might wanna talk to him because he's pretty good at this and that's how it all comes together and again that's another process. It doesn't happen instantaneously you'll learn and you can get frustrated just like you did. 06:22 How you will when you think about when you're progressing in your career but all you're doing is putting your bricks together to build a house for yourself down the road and that's how this all really works out for you and I'm telling you it works )\Kɝb[*%J&7zݯJɘOu4>* ""J&7zݯJɘOu4>hβ* (J&7zݯJɘOu4>hϲ* #J&7zݯJɘOu4>hϲ* 4J&7zݯJɘOu4>hϲ",2025-09-10T18:51:57.019255,2025-09-10T18:51:57.019274,4

In a wildly funny and brutally honest interview, Henry Coleman drops some comedic wisdom about love, timing, and the ticking clock of attractiveness. Reflecting on advice he once gave his sister, Henry hilariously warns, “If you’re not married yet, you’re just not ugly enough to make it work.” His theory? Once the ugly sets in, people suddenly find a way to fight for love—because they know it’s their last shot. He paints a vivid picture of his dream destination: a jazz fest filled with couples over 40, dressed in linen, sipping wine, watching old R&B acts, and pretending they didn’t just argue in the car. He describes this phase—between age 213 and 270 (his joke on feeling ancient)—as the final lap before people finally find a church home and settle into Christian maturity. But underneath the laughs is a sobering truth. “God gives us everything up front—youth, energy, beauty—and H (b2 $761290E7-F183-43B3-A511-AFFA4EBE8A04 H (h",2025-09-10T18:51:57.285964,2025-09-10T18:51:57.285975,4

8041_2676,"In university financial statements, capital gifts ...","In university financial statements, capital gifts are categorized as above the line or below the line based on their impact on operating versus non-operating revenues. The distinction typically follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and university-specific policies. Here’s how they are determined: 1. Above the Line (Operating Revenue) Capital gifts appear above the line (included in operating revenues) when: • They are for current operations or annual giving campaigns. • They fund expenses directly related to the university’s core activities (e.g., instruction, research, student services). • They are unrestricted or temporarily restricted for operating use. • They support projects like minor facility improvements or specific equipment purchases tied to an operating budget. 2. Below the Line (Non-Operating Revenue) Capital gifts appear below the line (excluded from operating revenues) when: • They are for endowments, meaning they are permanently restricted and generate investment income. • They fund capital projects, such as constructing a new building or major renovations. • They are part of capital campaigns where funds are raised for long-term asset purchases. • They are restricted by donors for non-operating purposes (e.g., creating a named scholarship fund that only distributes income). Key Considerations • Donor Intent & Restrictions: If a donor specifies that a gift must be used for capital improvements or endowments, it is treated as a non-operating (below-the-line) revenue. • Accounting Standards: Universities typically follow FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) rules for private institutions and GASB (Governmental Accounting Standards Board) rules for public institutions, which may influence classifications. • Internal Policies: Some universities have specific financial policies dictating what qualifies as an operating versus a non-operating gift. Would you like to see an example financial statement to illustrate this distinction?",2025-09-10T18:51:57.565809,2025-09-10T18:51:57.565820,4

Save big this school year by shopping smart! Amazon - will have some really low prices given how they operate as the low price provider. However, watch those shipping prices! BJs/Costco/Sams - will all have similar prices for the bulk goods like wipes, paper towels, etc. Tax Free Weekend - watch your cashflow and have money planned for the tax free weekend, which will save you 5-7% depending upon where you live. So far this year, prices on notebooks are now $1.50, down from $2.00 last year, and backpacks are just $25.00 versus $30 last year. Another thing to remember is that you should start putting away $$$ each month earlier in the year for all this stuff. Just like putting away $$ for their Christmas gifts begins in April.

Often, for the big picture things that you are trying to change, just do and show, don’t tell. Here’s how you get that ball rolling: Set Clear Goals: Define your financial, career, and personal goals. Be specific and write them down. Then look at them EVERY SINGLE DAY when you wake up. And AT NIGHT when you go to sleep. Long-term thinking helps you stay focused and motivated. Build a Support Network: Cultivate friendships with like-minded individuals who support your vision. Networking and positive relationships can provide valuable guidance and encouragement. One of the consistent themes you’ll see with us is keep folk around you that are helping you. Remove those that are not. Invest in Yourself: Continuously learn and develop new skills. Career development and personal growth are essential for reaching financial freedom and building a successful future. All of the little skills, techniques, and FAILURES you encounter are teaching you. The process that you’re undertaking will ultimately allow you to STAY in the place that you’re reaching for.

Start by sitting down with your mate and talking about a wish list of things you both want to do, then talk about the weekly and monthly things that make those things possible. For successful relationships, focus on open communication, quality time, and mutual support. By partnering with your significant other, you can create a powerful synergy that propels you both toward your dreams. Always keep the big picture from step one in mind and communicate with each other how some the behaviors you two have expressed take you way from step 1. Remember, long-term thinking means making small, daily choices that align with your bigger vision. Keep working on these habits, and watch how they transform your life over time.

14425_4740,I think one of the biggest obstacles that many peo...,"I think one of the biggest obstacles that many people have when it comes to this transformation that you have to go through the spiritual essence of it is that they think of themselves too little and because you think of yourself too little in a way that I don't know I'm not that smart and you make yourself small you make yourself to start think that you're not deserving of the thing that you really want to gain or you want to learn or you want to receive some people take it the opposite way and they think they should get everything just because that's them but often that narcissism that comes along with it they may get some of the things but they don't get truly the things that they value and want so one of the biggest obstacles in the way to get around that obstacle is again the Bible kind of talks about it on a lot of different places that you're worthy of it because he created you to align with him so that you can fulfill your purpose and get all the things that you ever wanted to get through him so the spiritual aspect of this really shows you where you need to go and what you need to do so to get around that obstacle as you pray and read through for me again, the Bible, what you'll see is that all these people will hugely flawed in some instance and not so hugely fed in others, but they all had flaws. There was always something wrong with them. They were not perfect, and it gets lost on a lot of people because, again, when they talk about the Bible and the teachings in the Bible, everybody focuses on Jesus and that's it. That's the example. Well, that's example of, sure, it's an example of God manifesting itself, but that's not then everyday human being. All the other regular people in the Bible, Moses is David, Joshua, just regular folk that weren't conceived the way Jesus was. So your comparison to that as a guidepost to say, well, I have to be perfect like that, is often one of the big obstacles. Instead, once you realize, like Paul does, of how flawed he really was and that even in those flaws, you'll be able to do great things. Like he did applies to you. And once you really cement that thought and process in your mind and really make it yours and really focus, like, I don't have to be perfect. I've just got to be obedient and take one step at a time. It changes things. Once you get out of this notion of perfection that the world will try to tell you and say well, if you're not perfect, then you can't do it. Everything opens up because again, you're not a perfect being. We We're all flawed. We all make mistakes. We all do things we shouldn't do. Small things are big things, but you can bounce back from them and that guilt and feeling of well, I did this wrong. There's no way it can work out for me again wrong it can and it will. If you follow the principles that are in that book and you think about how to stewage your life, especially when it comes to your finances, how it's going to be so important and one of the big picture things that I don't really get too much into in this book, but you'll see more through the app and some of the things that we post is that the world is changing and the world is changing in a sense that you not being in alignment will be easier pickings for you to get your life that you want from everything that you experience taken from you your money, your family, your friends, all that can be taken from you and you could be out there on your own because all the safety nets you're leaving from us healthcare you're gonna be on your own for that in another 20 years. It's going to be every person for himself all of these things are going to require that at this point in time as we develop in this country, you really got to think longer and deeper. You can't just make snap decisions for the day, not knowing that they're gonna turn into something worse for you down the road one of the beauties of this app is that it starts to help you form that mindset because we're always sticking out into the future. We're always looking at the important dates that you put down there so that you know hey if I don't get my stuff together me taking that trip with my girls it's gonna be really hard cause right now I'm behind 500 bucks you know whatever it may be or hey if I don't really get this under check and really stay and stew it this money well, I'm not gonna be able to pay for my kids football camp and you know it's eight weeks that mindset change is the start and once you start thinking about that on the neare term things, the longer term things for not just retirement, but it'll change your mindset of like I've really got to figure out and do my best and become a better person because I need to make more money because I'm going to have to take care of my mom in 10 20 years because she's by herself. She's never been married and I'm going to have to take care of her a health careare side and you know, have a place for her to live. So wow, I got to really, really, I got to really work hard and really ask for that vision and that clarity on where I should be and what I should be working on. So the likelihood of that happening where we're both, you know, in the dumps and can't get anything done gets lessened and you've got to think about it and work on it each day. This app's going to help you think about it much more than you ever did before so that you get out of the mindlessness of just worrying about the latest trend or something else and you don't focus on that 90% of the time instead of that's 5% of the time and the other time you're thinking about the next steps you need to make to create the life that you've always wanted to have",2025-09-10T18:51:57.122219,2025-09-10T18:51:57.122232,3
14422_4737,The number one thing that we all have to do is rea...,"The number one thing that we all have to do is really ground ourselves in something bigger than us and the Bible and our faith and those types of philosophies are what we hope really should clean go onto they should be the cornerstone of all the things that you do and all the decisions that you make in life. Now doing so doesn't make you pious. It doesn't make you better than others, which certainly doesn't line up with any piece of religious literature that we ever encounter on this planet. What it does do is it gives you a grounding to help you make decisions better decisions for the people around you for yourself most importantly and decisions that affect others again, I'm not a preacher. I'm not even a deacon, but what I do know is that consistently reading through God's word and what God is serve and what God you look at and what God you pay attention to is your business. But what I do know is that using that as a cornerstone really gives you a bigger picture on what you're working towards and in the stories and in the lessons that each of these books has there's somebody that's gone through something that's dealt with something, who's gone from rads the riches back to rags, back to riches and encounter all kinds of challenges and all of them have known that there was a greater power and force at work that would help them if they called on it. Your job is to figure out what that is and to start to as the book says meditate on these things. Now there are several verses we can go to and Romans, Paul and Acts. You can look at the stories of Joshua, my favorite in the Bible and see that all these things require you to keep that connection to God in place and is a constant communication just recently I was watching something on the gram. I believe we're Kat Williams did an interview with Theo Vaughn. They were going back and forth and two people who on the surface look and couldn't be more different, but both really talked about their relationships with God and Kat made some very insightful comics, despite what most people may think of who they think might be crazy, but he's very grounded and knowing that the thing that has sustained him and gotten him out of trouble and helped to make him wealthy, to help him influence others, and allowed him and given him the ability to help people came from God, and it came from as he said in the interview, his constant communication with the creator and the biggest thing that he that came out of what he said, that Theo couldn't, you know, really refute and was like, absolutely was the fact that what you get from having a spiritual connection in some form of fashion is that you don't have to depend on you and that's the thing that often gets lost on that. If you keep this constant communication going, if you keep this as the basis of how you make all the decisions in your life, and especially the financial ones, what you'll figure out is that I don't have to depend on me. I just need to depend on doing and obeying the instructions. I'm given because I'm so close and so interwhelmed with what he wants me to do that it's not going to fail. It may not happen exactly when you wanted to, and according to your plan, but it's going to happen. And for me personally, what I thought might happen in five years happened in 10 what I thought might happen in 10 winds up happening 20 what I thought might happen in pretty quickly took a much longer period of time and that comes down to this tool that I've built. I started working on this good gracious almost 8 years ago and in those eight years, I stopped and started stopped and started stopped and started, but I kept praying about it. Like I know you gave me this idea. You know, just tell me what I need to do to make it happen and quite literally in the past year, the stuff that I've been working on for the previous eight with the help of how things evolved in technology I literally built what I've been working on for months and months and months did it in weeks and that's the power of having that spiritual connection that will allow you to find whatever that thing that God has put in your heart and put in your mind and that's gonna be the vehicle that's gonna get you and turn you into the person that can be the person that can do the things so that you can have the things and help the people be around you. So I really need you to like tune in on that and we'll talk more about it",2025-09-10T18:51:57.128771,2025-09-10T18:51:57.128784,3

10424_3456,55Mingus notes on meme delivery,"55Mingus notes on meme delivery As a SaaS developer for a mobile-first personal finance app, the best delivery method for meme-based behavioral nudges is a hybrid approach: Deliver memes in-app first, and send a lightweight push notification or SMS only when the user has not opened the app within a relevant time window (e.g., 2–4 hours post-trigger). This approach balances cost, engagement, and user experience. Why In-App Delivery Is Best for Primary Engagement 1. Higher context + emotional impact: Memes are visual and often depend on tone and timing. Delivering them in-app lets you: • Animate the message • Pair it with budget visuals (“You blew your food budget—again?”) • Track reaction (did they scroll past, click, or engage?) 2. Cost-effective & safe: • No per-message cost like with SMS • Avoids compliance issues with text spam (TCPA) 3. Supported by Data from Industry Leaders: Platform Strategy Results Cleo AI Meme-style messages in-app + push Increased daily engagement by 47% Digit Uses in-app behavioral nudges + push reminders Helped users save over $5 billion Truebill (Rocket Money) Behavior alerts via push first, deep dive in-app 68% of users opened the app after push alert According to CleverTap’s 2023 Fintech Engagement Report: • In-app messages have a 4x higher click-through rate than SMS • Push notifications improve app retention by 40%+ over 30 days when paired with a behavior trigger Why (and When) to Use Text Messages (SMS) Text messages should be your backup channel when: • A behavior trigger is urgent (e.g., spending spree just created a deficit) • The user hasn’t opened the app in 4+ hours • You have prior consent for SMS (to avoid TCPA penalties) Important: SMS should contain a teaser: “Spendy noticed you’re in the mood to overspend. He’s got a meme waiting. Tap to see.” And link back to the app—not deliver the full meme in the message. Recommended Hybrid Meme Delivery Flow flowchart TD A[Behavior Trigger: Overspending] --> B[Check if App Open in Last 4 hrs] B -- Yes --> C[Show Meme In-App + Push Notification] B -- No --> D[Send SMS with Link to Meme in App] C --> E[Log Reaction] Technical Implementation Summary Channel Tool Trigger Logic Pros Cons In-App React Native / Flutter When user is active or app opened Best for engagement & UX Needs app open Push Firebase Cloud Messaging / OneSignal Instant trigger + 4hr reminder Free & high CTR Can be ignored SMS Twilio / MessageBird Trigger + app not opened in 4h High urgency, fallback Cost & compliance-heavy Final Recommendation (TL;DR): Use in-app delivery as your default, reinforce with push, and fall back to SMS only for cold users or urgent events. This gives you the highest user engagement at the lowest cost, with minimal legal risk. Would you like a push notification script library or a consent flow template for SMS compliance?",2025-09-10T18:51:57.363011,2025-09-10T18:51:57.363023,3

By following these steps, you can create a personalized e-book that effectively delivers your message and engages your readers. The optimal number of pages for an e-book related to personal finance can vary depending on the depth of the topic, the level of detail you want to provide, and the preferences of your target audience. However, a general guideline is to aim for a length that provides comprehensive information without overwhelming the reader. Typically, a concise e-book on personal finance can range from 30 to 100 pages. This allows you to cover essential topics, provide practical advice, and offer actionable steps for readers to improve their financial situation. It's important to strike a balance between providing enough information to be valuable and not making the e-book too lengthy that it becomes daunting to read. Consider the complexity of the subject matter and the level of expertise of your target audience. If you are targeting beginners or individuals with limited knowledge of personal finance, a shorter e-book may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if your audience consists of more experienced individuals or you are covering advanced topics, a longer e-book may be necessary to provide in-depth insights.

5671_1774,\You’re Never Too Young for a Roth I.R.A.,"\You’re Never Too Young for a Roth I.R.A. But there are rules around opening one for a child. First: The child must have earned income. Give this articleRead in app Credit... Till Lauer By Ann Carrns June 10, 2022 Has your teenager landed a summer job? Good! Now, consider putting your child’s earnings to work long term by opening a Roth individual retirement account. It may seem odd to think about retirement savings when your child could still be wearing braces. But putting money now into a Roth I.R.A. means your child will have decades for the money to grow, tax free. “Time is on their side,” Ed Slott, an authority on I.R.A.s, said of children with accounts. He opened a Roth for his daughter with a $350 contribution when she was 15. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story A Roth I.R.A. is a special retirement account. Unlike a traditional I.R.A., a Roth doesn’t give you a tax deduction for contributing. Most teenagers, however, don’t make enough to pay much income tax, so deductions are less valuable to them. The money in a Roth can be invested, and it grows tax free and can be withdrawn tax free as long as certain rules are met. Roths also have income caps that may limit contributions as a child’s salary increases, so starting young makes the most of the account’s tax-free growth. “The earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow and compound,” Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation, said. Many people don’t realize that there is no minimum age to open a Roth. “I do think it’s tremendously misunderstood,” said Cheryl Costa, a certified financial planner in Framingham, Mass., who opened a Roth I.R.A. for each of her three children when they turned 12. Here’s what to know. Your child must have earned income to qualify. This means getting paid by an employer or for jobs like walking dogs and babysitting. (Money paid by parents for household chores is a gray area; more on that later.) ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Most children aren’t likely to earn enough to make a large contribution on their own, and they may prefer to spend their earnings or save for shorter-term goals. “Convincing a child to hand over cash for retirement is especially difficult,” said Rita Assaf, vice president of retirement products at Fidelity Investments. But the money contributed to the Roth doesn’t have to come directly from your child’s pocket. Parents — or grandparents — who can afford to help can match a child’s contributions or deposit the entire amount, up to the amount the child earned. So if a teenager earned $1,000 working over the summer, a parent could contribute $1,000 to the Roth. (The maximum total contribution is $6,000 annually for people under age 50.) Susan Allen, senior manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said she had opened a Roth at age 16, with her father’s encouragement; he matched part of what she earned from working in retail and teaching ballet. “I have every intent to do it with my own children, too, when they have earned income,” she said. To help things go smoothly, keep documents showing that the contribution was valid in case of a tax audit, financial planners recommend. A child who receives a paycheck will get a W-2 form showing the earnings. If the money is from self-employment, it’s smart to keep a detailed log, noting the date, service provided and amount paid (such as “June 18, babysitting for the Smiths, $50”). ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story It may be helpful to have the child file an income tax return, Mr. Slott said, even if the income falls below the federal filing threshold. The return will document the earned income, he said, and can help with tracking contributions. Unlike contributions to a traditional I.R.A., contributions to a Roth I.R.A. (but not the earnings) can be withdrawn at any time, for any reason, without penalty, he said. And note: A child who earns more than $400 in self-employment income after expenses may have to file a return anyway; consult a tax professional. Most kids won’t earn much, but even a little can get the account started — and early saving can make a big difference over time. According to a hypothetical example from Fidelity, someone contributing $3,000 per year to a Roth from age 15 to 20, and then contributing the maximum allowed amount annually until age 70, could accrue more than $3 million, assuming an annualized return of 7 percent. The same person starting at age 20 would accumulate about a million less. Roths also offer flexibility. In general, to avoid taxes and penalties, an account owner can’t withdraw earnings before age 59½, and the Roth must have been open for at least five years. But there are exceptions for early withdrawals for certain reasons, like a down payment on a first home or college expenses. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story “Everyone’s situation is different and life throws curveballs, so it’s nice to know it’s an option if a rainy day happens,” Ms. Allen said. Ms. Costa strongly discourages early withdrawals of funds designated for retirement since doing so cuts into the account’s potential for long-term, tax-free growth. “That’s a dagger to the heart for me,” she said. Parents of a minor can open a Roth as a custodial account at most major brokerages. The parent manages the account on the child’s behalf until age 18 (or 21, in a few states). After that, control of the account shifts to the child. Since children will eventually be in charge, it’s important to involve them in monitoring accounts and to have ongoing talks about the benefits of long-term saving and investing, advisers say. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story “It’s encouraging them to save early and save often,” said Jeff Jones, director of financial planning at Longview Financial Advisors in Huntsville, Ala. Here are some questions and answers about Roth I.R.A.s for teenagers: How should funds in a teenager’s Roth be invested? Funds in a teenager’s Roth may be invested fairly aggressively in stocks because the time horizon is so long, Ms. Costa said; there are decades to recover from market dips. A low-cost, total market index exchange-traded fund can be a good choice, she said. Target date funds, which automatically shift investments from stocks to bonds over time, are an option but generally have higher fees — and some may have more exposure to bonds than necessary for such young investors, she said. Can payment for chores count as income for a Roth? Opinion varies on this question, so you may want to consult a tax adviser. James Lee, a certified financial planner in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said payment for chores could be considered earned income if the rate paid was “reasonable” and reflected what you would pay a nonfamily member. “You can’t pay a child $6,000 to mow the lawn” and then make a Roth contribution based on that amount, he said. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Payment for a substantial task that would otherwise require you to hire outside help could qualify, Ms. Costa said. But, she added, “I wouldn’t count the chore money.” Mr. Slott counseled caution: “It has to be legitimate and genuine work. You can’t pay kids to clean their room” and count that as income. Will a Roth I.R.A. affect college financial aid? That depends. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as FAFSA, is used by most colleges to assess a student’s eligibility for financial aid and doesn’t ask about retirement funds — so money sitting in a Roth won’t affect aid. (Pre-tax contributions to some retirement accounts must be reported on the form as “untaxed income,” but Roth contributions are made after taxes, so they’re not included, Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert, said.) But withdrawing funds from a Roth to pay for college expenses could affect financial aid down the road because the distribution counts as income on a subsequent FAFSA, Mr. Kantrowitz said. To avoid this, he said, college students should time Roth withdrawals carefully; it’s generally best to wait until at least the second semester of the sophomore year to tap Roth funds for education expenses. (Why? Because the FAFSA for a given academic year uses financial information from two years earlier.) ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story The CSS Profile, a separate form used by some mostly private colleges to allocate school aid, does ask about retirement holdings to provide “contextual” information to schools. This information isn’t included in institutional need calculations, however, so “it does not impact a student’s financial aid eligibility,” said Jaslee Carayol, a spokeswoman for the College Board, which administers the profile. However, Mr. Kantrowitz said that while retirement assets weren’t automatically included in the profile’s financial aid formula, they could affect aid eligibility at some colleges — especially if the family had what schools deem “excess” retirement savings. “After all,” he said, “if retirement savings doesn’t have an impact on financial aid, why would they ask questions about it?” A version of this article appears in print on June 11, 2022, Section B, Page 5 of the New York edition with the headline: Putting Your Teenager on the Road to Retirement.

For sales: Work on closing deals The whole point of freeing you up is so you can grow your business, whether it’s by finding new partners or new markets. Of course, this is also a part of the business that you can eventually train someone else to do. Until then, here’s a little cheat sheet on closing deals: Always learn how to qualify – Don’t waste your time on prospects that can’t use or can’t afford your product or service. Limit your “yeses” – Be careful that you don’t give away the farm when a customer makes a request. It’s easy to say “yes” to every request. However, some customers may never stop asking, and you’ll have unhappy customers and a much stressed out work force. Ask for something in return – Instead of simply promising a customer you’ll do something every time he or she asks, always ask for something in return. “Sure, we’ll give your weekly progress reports. Do you mind extending this to a six-month contract then?” Create urgency – A great way to close more deals is simply to put deadlines on requests. For example, point out to your potential customer that he needs to sign a contract before the end of the month; otherwise, you have to give away the one opening for the month to someone else. Explain why – When you ask for something in return or create urgency, you should explain why to your customer. If you don’t, that information gap will create suspicion. Even though there are more ways to close deals, I’ve found that those five boost my close percentages greatly. Once you’ve boosted your revenue, you can now look for a good successor. Custy!!!

6432_2046,There is limited research specifically focusing on...,"There is limited research specifically focusing on the impact of emotional spending by women in the United States. However, several general statistics related to women's spending habits and emotional factors can provide some insights. Here are a few leading statistics: 1. Consumer Spending: Women in the United States are responsible for approximately 70-80% of consumer spending. This indicates that women have significant purchasing power and influence over the economy. 2. Impulse Buying: Studies suggest that women are more likely than men to engage in impulse buying. Emotional factors, such as stress, mood, and desire for instant gratification, often contribute to impulsive purchases. 3. Retail Therapy: Retail therapy refers to the act of shopping to improve one's mood or emotional state. Research indicates that women are more likely to engage in retail therapy, using shopping as a means to alleviate stress, sadness, or boredom. 4. Emotional Triggers: Emotional triggers play a role in women's spending habits. According to a survey by CreditCards.com, 79% of women admitted to making an emotional purchase, with the most common triggers being stress (30%), sadness (25%), and boredom (16%). 5. Regretful Purchases: Women tend to experience more regret after making emotional purchases. A study by the Journal of Consumer Research found that women were more likely to regret buying items related to beauty, clothing, and accessories. It is important to note that these statistics provide a general understanding of women's spending habits and emotional factors. The impact of emotional spending can vary greatly among individuals, and further research may be needed to explore this topic in more depth.",2025-09-10T18:51:57.850914,2025-09-10T18:51:57.850927,2

What new capabilities would you prioritize Treasury developing to differentiate us from competitors like Morgan Stanley or Schwab?"" Question 2: Where We Play & How We Win ""Given your experience with our transition to becoming CFO and overseeing our diverse revenue streams—from SBL to fund distribution partnerships—where do you see the greatest opportunities for Treasury to create competitive advantage? How would you leverage our $48B+ SBL portfolio and multi-bank deposit relationships to win in markets where we're competing against both traditional banks and fintech disruptors?"" Question 3: Management Systems & Integration ""You've overseen our financial reporting through significant growth and the TriState integration. What management systems and governance frameworks should Treasury implement to ensure we can scale our cash management operations from $59B to potentially $100B+ while maintaining the control environment and regulatory compliance that supports our strong capital ratios?"" David Demas - Treasurer , TriState Capital Holdings Question 1: Winning Aspiration & SBL Strategy ""The TriState acquisition brought us a leading SBL platform that's grown to $48B+. How should Treasury operations support our aspiration to be the dominant player in securities-based lending? What role should Treasury play in expanding our addressable market beyond the current distribution partner network of RIAs and regional broker-dealers?"" Question 2: Integration & Operational Excellence ""Drawing from your Deloitte experience and the TriState integration, what capabilities must Treasury develop to seamlessly support both our traditional wealth management cash flows and the more complex SBL funding requirements? How would you ensure Treasury systems can handle the operational complexity while maintaining the cost efficiency that makes our SBL margins competitive?"" Question 3: Technology & Systems Modernization ""Given your experience integrating TriState's digital lending platform with Raymond James' broader infrastructure, what management systems should Treasury prioritize to create a unified, scalable platform? How would you balance the need for real-time SBL risk monitoring with traditional cash management efficiency, especially as we potentially expand internationally?"" Greg Rust - Chief Operations Officer Question 1: Operational Efficiency & Competitive Advantage ""Raymond James processes billions in daily settlements across our wealth management, SBL, and clearing operations. How should Treasury operations contribute to our winning strategy of providing superior service while maintaining cost efficiency? What operational capabilities must we build to win against competitors who may have larger scale but less integrated platforms?""

Given our diverse revenue streams—from ESP margins to SBL spreads to clearing fees—how would you structure Treasury operations to ensure we can maintain service levels and profitability even during market stress or regulatory changes?"" Question 3: Technology Integration & Automation ""With Raymond James investing $975M annually in technology, what management systems should Treasury implement to maximize operational leverage? How would you design Treasury workflows to support our aspiration of being the most advisor-friendly platform while ensuring we have the automated controls and monitoring needed for a $1.5+ trillion asset base?"" Katie Larson - Chief Accounting Officer Question 1: Governance & Strategic Risk ""Given your committee experience across Disclosure, Asset-Liability, and Risk Management, how should Treasury governance support our winning aspiration of maintaining independence while competing with larger firms? What capabilities must Treasury develop to ensure our financial flexibility remains a competitive advantage as we grow?"" Question 2: Regulatory Strategy & Market Positioning ""Where do you see regulatory requirements heading for firms our size, and how should Treasury position us to win in that environment? Given your Goldman Sachs background, how would you structure Treasury operations to ensure we maintain our well-capitalized status while supporting aggressive growth in SBL and wealth management assets?"" Question 3: Control Environment & Scalability ""What management systems and control frameworks should Treasury implement to support our growth trajectory while meeting the heightened expectations that come with our size and complexity?

14559_4784,..-AWS v. Godaddy Launch,"..-AWS v. Godaddy Launch Me: Explain the difference between a web based application and one that is purchased at the app store ChatBox: Web-based applications and applications purchased from an app store differ primarily in their deployment, access, and functionality: 1. Deployment: - Web-based Applications: These are hosted on servers and accessed via web browsers. No installation is required on local devices; users simply need an internet connection. - App Store Applications: These are typically downloaded and installed locally on devices (like smartphones or desktops) from an app store (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play). They are built for specific operating systems. 2. Access: - Web-based Applications: Accessible from any device with a browser, making them platform-independent. They require an internet connection to function. - App Store Applications: Typically platform-specific, meaning different versions are needed for different operating systems. Some may have offline functionality. 3. Updates and Maintenance: - Web-based Applications: Updated centrally by the developer, ensuring all users have access to the latest version without needing to install updates. - App Store Applications: Users must download updates individually through the app store, which can lead to variations in the versions used by different users. 4. Cost Structure: - Web-based Applications: Often subscription-based or free with ads. Usage is typically based on a recurring fee. - App Store Applications: May involve one-time purchase fees or in-app purchases, depending on the app's business model. 5. User Experience: - Web-based Applications: May have a less seamless user experience compared to native apps, as they might not utilize device-specific features as effectively. - App Store Applications: Usually offer a more polished user experience, fully integrated with the device’s operating system and features. In summary, the choice between a web-based application and one from an app store depends on factors like accessibility, device compatibility, desired features, and user experience. Me: Now explain the difference between hosting an app and landing page on Godaddy versus doing it on AWS or competitor to AWS. Explain the cost and technical differences ChatBox: Hosting an app and a landing page on GoDaddy versus AWS (Amazon Web Services) or its competitors involves several differences in technical capabilities, pricing models, scalability, and management. Here's a breakdown: 1. Hosting Environment: - GoDaddy: - Primarily a domain registrar and traditional web hosting provider. - Offers shared hosting, VPS (Virtual Private Server), and dedicated servers. - User-friendly interfaces for beginners, often with one-click app installations. - Ideal for small to medium websites and landing pages. - AWS (Amazon Web Services): - A cloud computing service offering a wide range of scalable resources (computing power, storage, databases). - Supports complex applications, microservices architectures, and large-scale web applications. - More technical setup; requires familiarity with cloud infrastructure. 2. Cost Structure: - GoDaddy: - Generally has a fixed pricing model. Hosting plans may start as low as a few dollars per month for shared hosting. - Pricing can increase significantly for higher tiers (e.g., VPS or dedicated servers). - Usually includes essential features in packages, but extra services often incur additional costs. - AWS: - Uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which can be more flexible but complex. - Costs vary based on usage (e.g., compute hours, data transfer, storage). - Can be cost-effective for larger applications with variable traffic but may become expensive if not managed properly. 3. Scalability: - GoDaddy: - Limited scalability primarily designed for smaller websites. - Upgrading plans involves migrating to higher tiers which may require downtime. - AWS: - Highly scalable; resources can be adjusted dynamically based on traffic or demand. - Offers a wide range of services to support scaling (e.g., Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing). 4. Technical Management: - GoDaddy: - More user-friendly for beginners. Less technical knowledge required for setup and management. - Support is typically included, but may have limitations on the depth of technical issues. - AWS: - Requires a deeper technical understanding of cloud architecture and services. - Extensive documentation and community support available, but users often need to manage their resources actively. - Offers advanced features like machine learning, analytics, and serverless computing. 5. Performance and Reliability: - GoDaddy: - Generally reliable for small to medium traffic but may experience slower performance compared to cloud solutions under high load. - Typically includes some level of uptime guarantee. - AWS: - Designed for high availability and performance across distributed architectures. - Offers multiple regions and availability zones to enhance reliability and reduce latency. Summary: - GoDaddy is suitable for small businesses or individuals looking for simplicity and ease of use, especially for landing pages or standard web applications. - AWS is ideal for developers and businesses needing a robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure capable of handling complex and variable workloads. Cost-wise, GoDaddy may seem more affordable for basic needs but can become limiting for growth. AWS offers a more complex pricing model that can be optimized for larger, scale-optimized applications, but careful monitoring is essential to manage costs effectively.

14432_4743,Chapter 4 Questions - Mental Health - Be Disciplin...,"Chapter 4 Questions - Mental Health - Be Disciplined Script Questions: ""Tell me about Step 4 - Mental Health Foundation. How does financial stress show up in people's lives? Money related stress can show up in how we treat ourselves each day - we think less of ourselves because we don’t have it Money related stress can show up in how we treat those closest to us - spouse, gf/bf, siblings, parents and kids Money related stress will then have us spending to feel good. Get that dopamine rush that only lasts today. What's the real cost of money anxiety? The real cost of money anxiety is that it costs us the future things that we want to have. It steers us away from being the person we imagine ourselves to be, which leads us away from DOING the things that we need to do, in order to have the things that we want. ""Describe Step 5 - Physical Wellness. How are physical health and financial health connected? Give me specific examples."" The rewiring and renewing we need to do can be accelerated by doing hard things. One of those hard things is being physically well. Not fit, but well. If you’re well, chances are that you can ultimately reach that fitness stage that makes sense for you. Here are the steps to get you started. ""Explain Step 6 - Habit Formation. What's the science behind changing money habits? How long does it really take?"" Habit formation starts with the previous chapter- the prayer and meditation help you become aware of what you are or are not doing. Start simple with one thing as small as a hygiene step at night or in the morning. Or a glass of water first thing. Stack wins this way. Give yourself grace knowing that you will not be perfect. You are not going to be. Instead, you want to start and string together streaks of the new behaviors you’re practicing. ""Share a story about someone who invested in therapy or counseling. How did that investment pay off financially?"" Tell a personal story about figuring out how I was getting in my own way. ""How does MINGUS track the connection between health spending and financial wellness? What does that look like in the app?"" Explain how the checkins are valuable data points for you to know and make the connection as to when your spending interacts with your mental and physical states. ""What's the difference between healthcare as prevention versus reaction? Give me the dollars and cents breakdown."" One of the things that this next chapter is going to handle and it really bridges serves the bridge for the chapter after it but is connected to the one before it is the whole concept of how your mental health foundation is a key thing that you have to do as you transform your life in this way. The goal overarch and goal of whatus is going to do is to transform the way you operate so that you can become this person that earns the money and knows how to use the money the way to continue to grow your life for himself if it goes around you and one of the key aspects of that is the stress that comes along with women financial stress is one of the most difficult things for a lot of people to handle. Some people hand it well some people ignore some people run from it, but what we're going to learn to do is to confront what's going on by consistently looking at our mental outlook and how it affects how we spin so money related stress shows up in everything we do oftentimes what happens is for some people it turns into retail therapy for some people that turns into spending on what you know going out so that you can forget what's going on in your life, but it affects it nonetheless and it takes away resources that you could be putting into yourself that will help you get that as they call it return on an investment and everybody's looking for one of the ways to handle it and approach it is one by the previous chapter finding your faith to lean because if you can lean on that, you don't have to put all the stress on yourself if you're believing in a higher power in a God, whatever you may call him or her, depending upon how you look at things if you're bleeding on that, you don't have to lean on yourself as much because you know you have help now that is one of the key foundational things, but you also have to change your mindset to how you approach your money so money related issues and stress can show up in just about everything we do. It shows up and how we speak and talk to ourselves and how we speak and talk to others and how we those words are very, very important because what we continually repeat to ourselves more than why can we gonna continue to do so what you've gotta do is in some people will say you need to develop a mantra mindset. Hey, you figure that part out and you can find something that inspires you that always makes you move forward and take action to confront whatever it is in front of you, but that's what you really focus on. You find something that you repeat yourself repeat to yourself so that you can get and get your mind in the mindset of that you're gonna be able to conquer all these things so you'll feel good about yourself when you do this once you start repeating these positive words and how you talk to yourself and how you say I am this person that's responsible I am a good third that's gonna pick up the skill I am going to put my finances on. I am that type of person and you continue to repeat those kind of things to yourself you will it's guaranteed as you keep telling yourself there's time and time again you'll get to where you try to go to now one of the big things that you have to think about is the cost of you not doing this is very, very great unfortunately in the world that we're living in now it's becoming more and more that the onus and responsibility is going to be upon you to make moves to make plans and to take action to put yourself in the best light no longer will we have the safety nets that we've kind of depended on and thought about and all those things are being taken away and as they get taken away one by one, we've really got to concentrate on what do I need to do to put myself in the best position and not focusing on one the mental aspect of this will certainly leave you behind so what you always have to really think about is the cost of you not doing this is pretty great now mathematically, you know, the application can show you the impact of hey if I don't pick up the skill, I make $10,000 less for my lifetime not just in one year, but calling for the next several years so that adds up to a house or the car that you love or the type of vacations you wanna take all those things add up because if you don't focus on how you talk to yourself and how you use that as fuel to put yourself in the best position when it comes to making more money so that you can take care of yourself and the people around you. It becomes that much more clear that hey I'm I'm out of I'm out of line. I'm not in alignment so you really have to focus on that physical aspect of it. I mean, that mental aspect, you've got to tell yourself it constantly remind yourself for some people like I said, I'd read their scriptures or they open up their Bible and read their Koran and they do these things to remind themselves that hey, they aren't in this alone and they have somebody to help them, and that's part of it. And with that help, you learned that, hey, you can get wisdom and discernment and clarity and a vision as to what you need to do next with your life. So that's why that's so important, and that's how it transfers over into the mental aspect of how you approach money because in the end, money is going to come and go, but if you stew it over it correctly and use it for the highest good that you have in your life, you're gonna be better off. One of the foundational elements that we have to developed and the mental aspect is the found started it all as being disciplined. The mental bip all it takes to the be yourself that things are going to help you grow and transform a critical, Previously, we just talked about how you have to continually talk well to yourself and tell yourself the good things that are coming your way and how you're basically sucking wins each and every day that are getting you one step closer to where you're trying to go that mental conditioning and mental health asper is crucial, taking one step at a time, moving forward to towards your world's the way to get there. Some days you'll be able to spurt faster to get to my girls. Some days it's going to be a slow walk, but you're still going to be moving forward. Up that mountain to what place around that bend to get to that final destination. And one of the freest that subits that mental aspect into place as your physical health. Being physically fit doesn't mean you have to look like a fitness model with 5% body fat, and you at the perfect weight. Instead, where it starts is just taking in small steps that get bigger and bigger each day. They compound on each other, just like money. So the physical aspect for some of you already in place, some of you are the workout warriors. You get up, you do your thing, you go to your classes, you participate in your group classes, pick a ball, you cycle, whatever it may be. However, some of you, it's something new, something that you haven't done before in the best way to success gets done, it is simply this. Pick an activity and go into five minutes of it. Just five minutes. If you just joined the gym, then it's going to be a new habit for you, take the time and take five minutes and go do whatever it is take the time and just go walk on the trip for five minutes and then just leave the next day do the same thing before you know that five turns of the second minutes that seven minutes will turn into 15 next thing you know you're here for a half an hour because you've done and you've created this new pathway. You're a lose your mind and your body to do things that you need to do and want to get you trying to go that is the heart part of the transformation and having your physical health in place is very peaceful to your mom and that's one of the things that application would do. It's going to show you the connection between how you think well about yourself when you check in and you're spinning the habits and the mental health and how you wind up spending your money, what you're spending on, where you spending on as you notice this becomes super hyper aware of what's happening in your life and once you know that that's the key thing and that's what we have we're just rewiring and renewing these thought processes that will help you get ahead. The physical part of it is crucial and I'm telling you, all you got to do is just start. That's what's so simple about this. It's not always easy but if you just start and follow your plan, you're going to get there if you do it well, you get there in a short amount of time and then it's on to the next day. If you take time to do it, hey, you're still going to get there, so don't get this hardened by not seeing it overnight. It's a new habit, it's a new thing that you have to do, and you're going to do it. Next, we've talked about the cornerstone of faith and how that's the first block that you need then you build upon that block on your mental outlook your mental outlook is gonna dictate so much of your daily behaviors that once you become aware of it, you see how that affects how you spend and where you place value and the things that you buy and the things you use your money on then we talked about the physical aspect, the physical aspect built on top of the mental aspect, which is built on top of the cornerstone of faith those three things when you combine them together get you in the best condition to battle everything that comes your way mentally and the physical toll that you know everyday life takes on your body that physical toll actually turns into real money. If you don't mind your health, you wind up having a number of conditions that cost you money. If you don't mind your health and you eat badly, you raise your blood sugar levels because you're not eating welly and you're not sleeping well that turns into diabetic medication so you're buying insulin Jardine some other form to help you regulate your blood sugar now again if you have health insurance, which is only getting more expensive you're still gonna be paying for it. It's gonna be money out of your pocket that you could be putting into yourself that gives you a better return on anything I can if you don't take care of your health walk run lift weights do some type of physical activity You can cholesterol and heart problems. There again is another hundred50 out of your pocket every month taking care of those things so if you think about it and you've really meditate on it, you'll see that hey wow, this is right. If I don't take care of these things that extra 200 bucks that I can invest in myself or put into savings or put it into an S&P 500 fund turns into real money down the road that I'll need to sustain me so when you do that, you're really building habits and discipline to think about those things and act upon those things in everyday life and that is what adds up to your ultimate success forming these habits just takes a start. What you have to do is start one day and like I said before when I was talking about the physical aspect, take five minutes to work on your health as you do that and do that consecutively all of a sudden if five turns into 10 10 turns into 15 next thing you know you've joined a fitness class at the Y you're hanging out with one of your girls that goes to a Zumba class or if you dudes you're lifting weights with the boys at the gym like it turns into something that repeatedly you see and get the benefits from that is the habit now share a story with you about that so one time I left the job and started working at a new job making it about the same money and when it was all said and done, I was living in a new place didn't have a lot of friends and was just falling into a rut. I was going to work coming home sitting in front of the TV and then it just hit me one day you know after I'd you know gotten up early one morning I was like I need to go do something so I just get up and just did a jog around my parking lot in my neighborhood that suddenly all of a sudden turned into man I've been doing this like three times a week. Maybe I should join you know a group or go to local wide and then I started going to the local Y and then at the local wide, I discovered how to oh man there's this other thing called CrossFit. I started doing that, but all of that's to say is that it grew into this habit that then all of a sudden the discipline I was showing there started showing up in different areas of my life and that propelled me to say, you know, I can do more and instead of just staying and engineering, I said hey man, I've read and heard about this other career trap and I started exploring that and boom next thing you know, I was on the rocket ship going back to grad school, which ultimately leads me here, which turned my life around and made me way more money than I'd ever make making diapers and making in Georgia so all that's to say is that these things compound them itself in the over time and before you know it, you're on a whole new path, going to whole new heights and this is the thing that you really will focus on when you use this app this app does a number of amazing things and it's using great technologies to help you see and give you feedback on how your mental physical health is turning into changing the way that you interact with money and interact with the world and it shows you how if I invest back into myself and brand new skills and learn new things can either leads to me starting my own business and having a side hustle or getting a better job if I just prefer to stay in a corporate route that takes me up to New Heights it puts you in a whole new path because you are going to need that whole new path in this dynamic new world that we are immersed in it's changing every day. They're taking things away, which makes you have to depend on the skills and things that you have in order to make a living just to breathe and eat it's it's hard but as you get to learn to do harder things, you learn to be more comfortable in these new circumstances that are being forced on us and making a way for you in the future and that future in turns to protect you to protect your kids, protect your loved ones those people closest to you because those are the most important things that you really need to focus on right now.",2025-09-10T18:51:57.119083,2025-09-10T18:51:57.119097,1

Which market should we attack? How should we win this market? What are the must have capabilities? What systems will you use to win? Warm digital greetings! I'm excited to be your go-to assistant. Whether you have questions, concerns, or simply need help, I'm here for you. What’s on your mind today? Me: What are the 5 key questions that must be answered to have an effective strategy according the HBR ChatBox: According to Harvard Business Review, having an effective strategy involves answering the following five key questions: 1. What is our purpose? - This question addresses the core mission of the organization, defining the reason for its existence and what it aims to achieve. 2. Where do we compete? - Identifying the markets or segments in which the organization will operate is essential for directing resources and efforts effectively. 3. How do we compete? - This involves determining the competitive advantage the organization will pursue, such as cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. 4. What are our core capabilities? - Understanding the unique strengths and resources that the organization possesses is crucial for leveraging them in the competitive landscape. 5. How will we implement our strategy? - This question focuses on the execution aspect, including resource allocation, organizational structure, and the processes needed to carry out the strategy successfully. These questions collectively guide organizations in formulating a clear and actionable strategy that aligns with their goals. Me: Describe the three key questions that I should answer for each of the 5 to get a good handle on what my strategy should be ChatBox: For each of the five key strategy questions, here are three additional questions that can help you gain a deeper understanding and formulate a robust strategic plan: 1. What is our purpose? - What specific goals do we want to achieve in the short and long term? - How do our values and mission align with the expectations of our stakeholders? - What impact do we want to have on our customers, community, and industry? 2. Where do we compete? - What are the characteristics and needs of the target markets or customer segments? - Who are our main competitors in these markets, and what differentiates us from them? - What trends or changes in the marketplace could affect our position? 3. How do we compete? - What unique value proposition do we offer that resonates with our target customers? - What are the key resources and capabilities required to support our competitive strategy? - How will we measure success in achieving our competitive advantage? 4. What are our core capabilities? - What competencies do we have that set us apart from our competitors? - Are there any gaps in our capabilities that need to be addressed to improve performance? - How can we leverage our strengths to capitalize on market opportunities? 5. How will we implement our strategy? - What specific actions and initiatives will we prioritize to execute our strategy? - What resource allocations (time, personnel, finances) are necessary for successful implementation? - How will we monitor progress and adapt our strategy based on performance feedback? By answering these supplementary questions for each of the five key strategy questions, you can create a more comprehensive and detailed strategic framework that can guide your organization effectively.

Instead of constantly seeking external validation, they help people focus on internal fulfillment and purpose. Here are three techniques they use: 1️⃣ Clarify Your Values: Therapists often start by helping you identify your core values. Knowing what truly matters to you is essential in defining success. Action Step: Write down your top 5 values and reflect on how they align with your current goals. 2️⃣ Set SMART Goals: Ministers and therapists alike encourage setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals to make your vision tangible. Action Step: Break down your big dreams into smaller, manageable goals using the SMART framework. 3️⃣ Build a Support Network: Success isn’t a solo journey. Ministers emphasize the importance of community, while therapists encourage accountability partners to help you stay on track. Action Step: Reach out to a mentor, join a support group, or find an accountability buddy to share your journey with. Statistics show that individuals who follow these techniques are 60% more likely to achieve their goals within five years. Not only do they experience greater personal satisfaction, but they also build stronger relationships and communities along the way. In contrast, those who stay on the endless quest for more often experience a 30% increase in stress and anxiety over time, leading to burnout.

Studies show that revisiting a toxic relationship can lead to a 60% decrease in self-esteem, making it difficult to rebuild your confidence and trust in yourself. Here are three techniques to prevent yourself from returning to a relationship that isn’t good for you: 1️⃣ Set Clear Boundaries: Block their number and remove them from your social media. Out of sight, out of mind. Also, don’t hit the places where you will probably run into them. Instead, try new spots. 2️⃣ Focus on Your Growth: Invest in hobbies, friendships, and goals that uplift you. Surround yourself with positive influences and other friends that will hold you accountable if you attempt to spin back around. 3️⃣ Practice Mindfulness: Reflect on the reasons the relationship ended and remind yourself why it’s better for your well-being to stay away. Remind yourself that a new and better experience will take the place of what was not working for you. Chalk it up to the game…. Psychological evidence shows that returning to a bad relationship, especially after a night of drinking, can impair your ability to use positive self-talk. However, research indicates that consistently using positive self-talk after ending a toxic relationship can boost your self-esteem by up to 40%. This practice helps you develop a healthier relationship with yourself and lays the foundation for more fulfilling relationships in the future.

If you're more of a spender, especially on luxury gear, and he's thrifty, starting the conversation with understanding and openness is key. Here are three conversation openers to help bridge the gap: ""I’ve noticed we have different approaches to spending. How do you feel about finding a balance that works for both of us?"" ""I respect how careful you are with money. Can we talk about how we can align do a lil bit of what you want and also get the things that I like?""

Studies reveal that those who care too much about others' opinions are 50% more likely to experience anxiety, which can hinder success. On the flip side, cultivating self-belief and faith in your own path is linked to higher achievement and life satisfaction. To shift your focus inward and build a stronger foundation in self-belief, try these daily habits: 1️⃣ Reduce exposure to comparisons and external judgments. 2️⃣ Focus on what truly matters to you, not what impresses others. 3️⃣ Daily reflection on your strengths and progress fosters self-affirmation.

It's crucial to re-establish these boundaries to maintain both personal happiness and financial stability. Here are three conversation openers and techniques to help you have this important discussion: 1️⃣ Start with Affirmation: Begin by acknowledging the positive aspects of your relationship before diving into boundary-setting. Conversation Opener: ""I really value how we’ve grown together over the years, and I think it’s important for us to reset our boundaries given the way we have been talking with each other.” Why it works: Affirmation sets a positive tone and reduces defensiveness, making your partner more open to the conversation. 2️⃣ Use ""I"" Statements: Focus on your own feelings and experiences rather than blaming your partner. Conversation Opener: ""I’ve been feeling dog walked lately, and I think it would help if we could discuss how we handle our finances together."" Why it works: Psychological research shows that ""I"" statements reduce the likelihood of conflict, as they focus on personal experiences rather than accusations. 3️⃣ Be Specific and Action-Oriented: Clearly define the boundaries you want to set and suggest actionable steps to maintain them. Conversation Opener: ""To make sure we’re both cool, I think it would be good to have a weekly sit down about how we are spending money and create some new savings goals."" Why it works: Specific boundaries and actionable steps help both partners understand what is expected and how to achieve it, reducing ambiguity and financial stress. Without clear boundaries, financial issues can escalate, leading to stress, arguments, and potentially even relationship breakdowns. Don’t let it get to that point—start the conversation today.

Here are three key questions to ask (try using one at each meet up instead of giving them the full interview treatment) —and why they matter for your long-term success, financial independence, and positive mental outlook: ""What is your long-term vision for your life?"" Understanding your partner's vision is essential for aligning your future goals. Research shows that couples who share similar life visions are 75% more likely to experience long-term success. This question helps ensure that your paths are compatible and that you’re both working towards a future that excites and fulfills you. ""What steps are you currently taking to achieve your purpose?"" It’s one thing to have a purpose, but it’s another to actively pursue it. Ask for specific examples, like educational pursuits, career advancements, or personal development efforts. Statistically, individuals who actively work towards their goals are 50% more likely to achieve financial independence. This question ensures that your partner is proactive and committed to their growth, which bodes well for your future together. ""How do you handle setbacks and challenges?"" Life is full of obstacles, and how your partner responds to them can make or break your relationship’s future. People with a strong purpose and positive mental outlook are 40% more likely to overcome setbacks and stay on track. This question helps you gauge their resilience and whether they have the mental fortitude to navigate life’s challenges with you. On the flip side, couples who don’t discuss their purpose and life goals are 2 times more likely to face conflicts and dissatisfaction, leading to a higher risk of relationship breakdown. 💬 What questions do you think are essential for understanding a partner’s purpose?

A financial plan helps you navigate these changes by building a safety net. Did you know that 63% of people without a financial plan struggle to adapt to unexpected job changes? Having a plan ensures you’re prepared for whatever the future holds. Achieve Financial Independence: Financial independence means having the freedom to live life on your terms, without being tied to a paycheck. Statistics show that those who follow a financial plan are 80% more likely to achieve financial independence by retirement age. Planning your savings, investments, and spending is the pathway to true freedom. Maintain a Positive Mental Outlook: Financial stress is one of the leading causes of anxiety and depression. In fact, 72% of Americans report feeling stressed about money. A well-thought-out financial plan can reduce this stress, providing clarity and peace of mind, which leads to a healthier, more positive mental outlook. Statistic to Note: On the flip side, individuals who don’t have a financial plan are 3 times more likely to experience financial stress and 2 times more likely to fall short of their financial goals.

Here’s a guide on how to frame it: 1. **Start with ""I"" Statements**: Focus on how you feel and what you need, rather than blaming or accusing. This makes it less likely for your partner to become defensive. - *Example*: ""I feel overwhelmed when we discuss sensitive topics late at night. I need us to talk about these things earlier in the day."" 2. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what your boundary is and why it’s important to you. - *Example*: ""I need time to myself every evening to unwind. It helps me recharge and be more present with you."" 3. **Offer a Solution**: If possible, suggest a way to honor the boundary while maintaining the relationship. - *Example*: ""Can we set aside 30 minutes each day to check in with each other and discuss anything on our minds?"" 4. **Acknowledge Their Feelings**: Recognize that your boundary might affect your partner and show that you’re open to finding a compromise. - *Example*: ""I understand that this might be different from what you’re used to, and I’m willing to talk about how we can make this work for both of us."" 5. **Stay Consistent**: Reinforce the boundary gently but firmly if it’s challenged or crossed. - *Example*: ""Remember, I need that time in the evening to myself. Let’s talk after I’ve had a chance to relax."" This approach combines clarity, compassion, and assertiveness, fostering understanding and respect within the relationship.",2025-09-10T18:51:57.619878,2025-09-10T18:51:57.619890,1

Studies show that people who engage in consistent self-care practices have 60% lower stress levels and improved mental health. Make time each day for activities that nourish your body and mind, like exercise, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy. Set Healthy Boundaries: Knowing when to say ""no"" is a powerful act of self-love.

A study found that individuals who regularly practice positive self-talk are 80% more likely to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Replace negative thoughts with affirmations like, ""I am worthy,"" and ""I deserve success,"" to build confidence and resilience.

Research shows that people who live in alignment with their values experience 23% higher levels of life satisfaction. Take time to reflect on what drives you and make decisions that honor those values. Set Specific, Actionable Goals: Vague goals lead to vague results. Studies reveal that setting specific goals increases the likelihood of success by 42%. Break down your vision into clear, actionable steps for your mental health, relationships, and finances.

Here are three techniques to help you keep your weekend fun from turning into regret on Monday morning: Set Clear Limits Before You Go Out: Decide in advance how much you’ll spend, how many drinks you’ll have, and when you’ll call it a night. For example, leave your credit cards at home and carry just enough cash for the evening. This keeps you from overspending and making choices that could harm your financial plans. Choose Things That Will Line Up With Your Goals: Opt for social activities that don’t revolve around excessive spending or drinking. If you think that it’s gonna have you close to crossing that line - don’t do it. Roll Out With The Right Folk: Let your folk know that you aren’t trying to go crazy because you have some things you’re saving for and don’t wanna go overboard. If you’re tempted to make poor decisions, set an alarm with a reminder to what you told yourself earlier before you headed out. Remember, your financial future is shaped by the decisions you make every day—including the weekend!

When you embrace an attitude of complete responsibility, you unlock the power to shape your future. Here are three techniques to help you gain awareness of the control you ultimately have: Eliminate the Blame Game: Whenever you face a challenge, stop and ask yourself, ""What can I do to change this situation?"" For example, if you’re not seeing results in your career, instead of blaming external factors, take responsibility for your growth by learning new skills or seeking mentorship. This mindset shift empowers you to take action and create the outcomes you desire. Practice Self-Reflection: At the end of each day, reflect on your actions and decisions. Ask, ""Did I take full ownership today?"" If not, identify the areas where you can improve and commit to making better choices tomorrow. Over time, this practice will sharpen your self-awareness and strengthen your sense of control over your life. Set Clear, Actionable Goals: Instead of vague aspirations, set specific, actionable goals that you can directly influence. For instance, rather than saying, ""I want to be successful,"" break it down into concrete steps like, ""I will complete two professional development courses this month."" Taking ownership of your goals ensures that your success is in your hands. Remember, the key to ultimate success is realizing that you are the driver of your own life.

Here are three techniques to help deescalate conflicts and ensure you and your partner are on the same page financially: Use ""I"" Statements: Avoid blaming language by focusing on how you feel. For example, say, ""I feel stressed when we don’t discuss our spending,"" instead of ""You’re always spending too much."" This approach reduces defensiveness and opens up constructive dialogue, helping you both make sound financial decisions together. Active Listening: Show your partner you’re fully engaged by paraphrasing their words and acknowledging their feelings. Try saying, ""I hear that you're worried about our savings. Let's explore solutions together."" Active listening builds trust and ensures that both partners feel heard, leading to better financial cooperation and planning. Agree on a Cooling-Off Period: If a discussion gets heated, suggest taking a break. Use language like, ""Let's take a moment to cool off and revisit this when we're calmer."" This technique prevents impulsive decisions that can negatively impact your finances, like making large purchases out of frustration or withdrawing money without discussion. Remember, strong communication is the foundation of both a healthy relationship and sound financial management.

Don’t Let Love Cost You Your Financial Freedom 💸 #EmotionalHealth"" We've all been there—falling head over heels too quickly, only to later realize that love has blinded us to some serious red flags 🚩. When you’re caught up in the excitement of a new relationship, it’s easy to overlook behaviors that can jeopardize your emotional health and financial future. Here's what to watch out for: Constant Pressure to Spend: Do they constantly suggest expensive outings or pressure you to splurge? This could indicate a lack of respect for your financial boundaries—setting the stage for future conflicts over money and derailing your financial goals. Avoidance of Money Conversations: If they dodge discussions about finances or seem uncomfortable when the topic comes up, it’s a sign they might not be financially responsible. Transparency is key to building a solid foundation. Irresponsible Spending Habits: Do they live beyond their means, frequently swipe their credit card without a plan, or have a laissez-faire attitude about debt? These habits could end up being yours too if you’re not careful, trapping you in a cycle of poor financial decisions. Dependence on You for Financial Support: If they start leaning on you financially early on, this could be a major red flag. Relationships should be partnerships, not rescue missions. Prioritize your financial freedom and long-term stability. Ignoring Your Financial Goals: A partner who dismisses or undermines your financial aspirations is a red flag. You deserve someone who supports your journey to financial freedom, not someone who derails it. Remember, recognizing these red flags early can save you heartache and protect your financial health. Don’t let love blind you to what truly matters. Stay vigilant, stay empowered, and always prioritize your future.

Avoidance behavior is often linked to anxiety and stress. Automating tasks helps reduce the stress that builds up from having to make too many decisions, while visual reminders and breaking down tasks into smaller steps can mitigate procrastination. Finally, positive reinforcement creates a reward loop that encourages consistent behavior. Taking these steps can significantly reduce the stress associated with paying bills and improve your financial health. Here are 5 steps you can take to help tackle those dreaded bills: Understanding Avoidance: We often avoid bills due to stress and anxiety. Recognizing this can help us address the root cause. Example: “I noticed that avoiding my credit card bill gives me anxiety about my spending habits. Confronting this can help me manage my finances better.” Automate Payments: Set up automatic payments to ensure bills are paid on time without having to think about it. Example: “I automated my utility bills, and it’s been a game-changer! No more missed payments.” Visual Reminders: Use calendars, apps, or sticky notes to keep track of due dates. Example: “I set calendar reminders for my rent, so I get notified a few days before it’s due. Simple but effective!” Break Down the Task: Divide the payment process into smaller, manageable steps to reduce overwhelm. Example: “Instead of thinking about the whole amount, I focus on one bill at a time. Makes it less daunting!” Create a Reward System: Reward yourself for paying bills on time to build positive reinforcement. Example: “Treating myself to a small reward after paying my bills on time keeps me motivated and on track.” Follow us for more tips on managing your finances and achieving financial freedom! 🌟 #FinancialFreedom #MentalHealth #PersonalGrowth #AutomateYourLife #StressFreeLiving #MindfulMoney #FinanceTips #AnxietyRelief #BillPayingHacks #PositiveReinforcement By understanding and addressing the psychological reasons behind why we avoid paying certain bills, we can take proactive steps to manage our finances better.

Here are 5 steps to uncover the hidden repair and maintenance costs that car dealers won’t tell you: Check Online Reviews and Forums: Look up the car model on websites like Edmunds, CarComplaints, and dedicated car forums to find common issues and repair costs shared by other owners. Example: ""I found out that the XYZ model often has transmission problems around 60,000 miles, costing up to $3,000 to fix."" Get a Vehicle History Report: Use services like Carfax or AutoCheck to get a detailed history of the car. This report can reveal past accidents, maintenance records, and any potential red flags. Example: ""The history report showed repeated repairs for the braking system—something the dealer 'forgot' to mention."" Consult with a Trusted Mechanic: Before buying, have a mechanic you trust inspect the car. They can identify hidden issues and estimate future repair costs. Example: ""My mechanic found that the suspension system was worn out, which could cost $1,500 to replace soon."" Research Parts and Labor Costs: Look up the costs of common replacement parts and labor for the car model. Websites like RepairPal can provide estimates for various repairs. Example: ""I learned that the timing belt replacement for this car costs $800, not something the dealer highlighted."" Evaluate Warranty Coverage: Check if the car is still under manufacturer warranty or if an extended warranty is available. This can save you a lot on potential repairs. Example: ""The dealer didn’t mention that the warranty only covers powertrain, not the expensive electrical issues this car model is prone to."" Don’t let unexpected repair costs catch you off guard!

Research shows that reuniting with a past partner can disrupt your financial freedom and hinder your ability to form healthy, new relationships. Here's why: Psychological Facts and Statistics: Emotional Instability: Rekindling an old relationship often brings unresolved issues back to the surface, leading to emotional instability which can affect financial decision-making. Financial Impact: Couples who repeatedly break up and get back together are more likely to make poor financial choices due to stress and emotional turmoil. Self-Esteem: Going back to an ex can lower self-esteem, making you feel unworthy and less likely to pursue personal growth opportunities. Three Techniques to Prevent Going Back to Your Ex: Reflect on Past Issues: Write down the reasons the relationship ended and reflect on why it didn’t work. Remind yourself of the negative aspects and how they impacted your well-being. Example: ""Every time I miss my ex, I read the list of reasons we broke up. It helps me stay focused on why moving forward is better for me."" Set Clear Boundaries: Communicate with your ex about the need for space and establish firm boundaries to prevent falling back into old patterns. Example: ""I told my ex that we need to maintain distance to allow ourselves to grow independently. Setting boundaries is crucial for my emotional health."" Focus on Self-Improvement: Invest time in personal development activities like learning new skills, engaging in hobbies, and setting new goals.

The idea of being perfect is not only biblically incorrect but also sets us up for disappointment and frustration. Perfectionism can hinder our growth, damage our self-esteem, and prevent us from experiencing true joy. Here are three techniques to combat the tendency to seek perfection and instead embrace grace: Practice Self-Compassion: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a friend. When you make a mistake, remind yourself that it’s a part of being human and an opportunity to learn and grow. Set Realistic Goals: Break down your tasks into manageable steps and set achievable goals. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and recognize that progress is more important than perfection. Focus on Your Strengths: Shift your focus from your weaknesses to your strengths. Acknowledge and appreciate your unique talents and abilities, and use them to your advantage. Remember, it’s our imperfections that make us truly unique and beautiful. Embrace them and allow yourself to grow and thrive without the pressure of perfection.

Did you know that 60% of caregivers are women, and 20% of female caregivers are caring for both children and adults? Another unfortunate statistic is that you’ll prolly be carrying this load on your own or at best one other sibling to share the load with. Here are three steps to ensure your parents are cared for without compromising your financial goals: Start Early: Begin by discussing financial plans with your parents. Use online resources to understand their financial situation and plan for future expenses. Those future costs are directly tied to your career earnings. START NOW!! That will mean you have to start realistic conversations about where you all might end up living and what you want that standard of living to be like. If you’re young, start planning on what amount of cash it’s gonna take ON TOP OF what you need to save for yourself. If you parent isn’t married, its gonna fall on you. Explore Additional Resources: Look into long-term care insurance to offset costs. This can significantly ease the financial burden. But lemme tell you, it ain’t cheap. So, know in advance that you gonna need more $$$ in your pockets to devote to this issue. Build a Support Network: Start creating a network of family, friends, and professional caregivers. This will help distribute the responsibilities and provide emotional support. I would especially recommend talking to and increasing your network of real estate professionals. These talented folk will help you find that place that you’ll need to live in down the road. Taking these steps not only ensures your parents' well-being but also protects your long-term financial future. ✨ Start planning today and follow me for more tips on the process to start now to achieve the level of financial freedom that it will take in order to care for your loved ones. #FinancialFreedom #LongTermThinking #Caregiving #FamilyFirst #FuturePlanning #CareerGrowth",2025-09-10T18:51:57.654676,2025-09-10T18:51:57.654691,1

Ask yourself these critical questions: 1. Can I Afford the Down Payment? 20% of the price is the standard unless you’re a first time buyer. That’s a lot of $$$$. Putting that into a stock index fund might be a better short term plan. 2. Is My Career Stable? You’re going to need a steadily increasing income over time. AND you have to put money away for a rainy day as time goes by to cover the stuff that will pop up AND potential job losses too. Home ownership ain’t for the meek. So, you need to have a career plan that includes a steady income and a side hustle. 3. Am I Ready for Long-Term Commitment? You will often hear that you need to stay in a place for a certain number of years in order to purchase a home but that isn’t always the case if you buy one that can be a rental or is in a market that turns over frequently because there are buyers looking to get in. So, make sure you keep this in mind too. 4. How Will This Affect My Lifestyle? The last thing you wanna do is buy a spot and be poor. But you’re still trying to be outside doing stuff that costs you money you don’t have. Buying a spot shouldn’t always hurt your pockets after the initial saving and spending. You should still be able to live - vacation occasionally, purchase ‘fits, etc. Keep that in mind. Start thinking about how you’d answer these questions before you make the goal of purchasing a home.

7096_2323,==;Mingus - Transportation,"==;Mingus - Transportation Choosing the best car for your budget involves careful planning, research, and consideration of various factors to ensure that you make a well-informed decision. Here are some strategies to help you select the best car that fits within your budget: 1. Determine Your Budget: Start by setting a realistic budget for purchasing a car, taking into account your income, monthly expenses, and financial goals. Consider how much you can afford to spend on a car, including down payment, monthly payments, insurance, maintenance, and fuel costs. 2. Research Vehicle Prices: Research the prices of different car models that fall within your budget range. Consider factors such as brand, model year, mileage, condition, and features to find a vehicle that offers the best value for your money. 3. Consider Total Cost of Ownership: In addition to the purchase price, factor in the total cost of ownership, including insurance premiums, maintenance, repairs, fuel efficiency, and depreciation. Choose a car that aligns with your budget for long-term ownership. 4. Determine Your Needs: Consider your lifestyle, driving habits, and transportation needs when selecting a car. Determine whether you need a compact car, sedan, SUV, truck, or hybrid based on factors such as passenger capacity, cargo space, fuel efficiency, and safety features. 5. Prioritize Features: Identify the essential features and amenities you need in a car, such as safety features, infotainment systems, navigation, comfort options, and fuel efficiency. Prioritize features that are important to you while staying within your budget. 6. Compare Financing Options: Explore different financing options, such as auto loans, leasing, or cash payments, to determine the most cost-effective and suitable option for your budget. Compare interest rates, loan terms, down payment requirements, and monthly payments to find the best financing solution. 7. Shop Around and Compare Prices: Visit multiple dealerships, online car marketplaces, and private sellers to compare prices, negotiate deals, and find the best value for your budget. Be prepared to haggle and ask for discounts or incentives to lower the purchase price. 8. Consider Pre-Owned or Certified Pre-Owned Vehicles: Explore pre-owned or certified pre-owned vehicles as a cost-effective alternative to buying a new car. These options often offer lower prices, extended warranties, and quality assurance while still providing reliable transportation. 9. Test Drive and Inspect the Car: Before making a final decision, test drive the car to evaluate its performance, handling, comfort, and features. Inspect the vehicle thoroughly for any signs of damage, wear and tear, or mechanical issues that may impact its value and reliability. 10. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with automotive experts, car dealers, or financial advisors to get professional advice and guidance on choosing the best car for your budget. Consider seeking recommendations and reviews from trusted sources to make an informed decision. By following these strategies and taking a systematic approach to choosing a car within your budget, you can find a vehicle that meets your needs, preferences, and financial constraints while providing reliable and enjoyable transportation.

7079_2307,To calculate the total return for a dividend-payin...,"To calculate the total return for a dividend-paying stock, you would need to consider both the capital appreciation of the stock and the dividends received. The formula for calculating the total return of a dividend-paying stock is: Total Return = (Ending Price - Beginning Price + Dividends) / Beginning Price Here's how to calculate it step by step: 1. Determine the initial price of the stock when you purchased it (Beginning Price). 2. Determine the ending price of the stock when you sold it or are calculating the return for (Ending Price). 3. Add up all dividends received during the holding period of the stock. 4. Subtract the Beginning Price from the Ending Price and add the total dividends received. 5. Divide this total by the Beginning Price to get the percentage total return. For example, if you purchased a stock for $50, received $2 in dividends, and sold it for $60, the total return would be: (60 - 50 + 2) / 50 = 0.24 or 24% total return. This calculation helps you determine the overall return on your investment in the stock, taking into account both capital gains and dividend income. I’ve created this with ChatBox. You can do it too!

Community hospitals that have fought to stay independent may be ripe takeover targets later this year as health systems assess coronavirus-related financial trauma. Hospital M&A has been robust in recent years, driven less by financial stress than by strategic initiatives to achieve geographic scale, according to Carsten Beith, co-head of health systems M&A at Cain Brothers. Dealmaking in the space dipped slightly in 2019 versus previous years. According to data from healthcare-focused boutique investment bank Ponder & Co, there were 85 announced hospital transactions last year, against 116 in 2018 and 118 in 2017. Mergermarket data show 248 transactions among healthcare providers as a whole for last year, compared with 321 in 2018 and 294 in 2017. null GETTY The novel coronavirus has set hospitals of all sizes into a tailspin as providers work overtime to service an influx of patients. And independent community hospitals, many of which were under-resourced to begin with, are now in critical need of scale, said Hector Torres, a healthcare managing director at Focal Point Partners. Community hospitals without best-in-class specialists and physicians are ill prepared to take on an entirely new type of patient, Torres said. “And these small hospitals have to spend resources on intake, only to refer a patient to a larger health system because they don’t have an otolaryngologist to deal with a coronavirus patient,” Torres added. “So the economic value of treating that patient has left your system and you basically gave that value to your competitor.” While the duration of the epidemic remains open-ended, some health systems and hospitals may not be able to wait out the crisis before pursuing a transaction. Torres said his firm has seen an uptick in inbound inquiries in recent weeks from hospitals seeking relief in the form of refinancing or a sale. Additionally, independent hospitals that were previously pursuing joint venture-type partnerships might instead opt for an outright sale, according to King & Spalding Partner Torrey McClary. “I have a client who was interested in acquiring a hospital, but that hospital was instead proposing service-line JVs and other ways of collaborating and accessing the brand and resources of my client as a hospital,” McClary said. “That hospital is now coming back and saying, ‘Actually, let’s talk about an acquisition.’” Some consolidators are either moving forward with transactions that started prior to the crisis, or are “evaluating the market and saying, this is an opportunity to achieve strategic affiliations in an environment that’s highly uncertain,” said Beith of Cain Brothers. That said, many health systems are deploying any available manpower towards handling the crisis, rather than diligencing deals. “Is a [hospital] board going to vote on its future via a Zoom call or a WebEx?” said Eb LeMaster, a managing director at Ponder & Co. “To literally get the people together to make the decisions, we’re finding that’s on hold. I’m not saying every process is on hold, but major decision-making is very challenging.” The urgency for a transaction could increase by June—when the fiscal year ends for many health systems, LeMaster said. Elective procedures, which are normally cash cows for hospitals, are being delayed indefinitely, while the capital markets have been knocked into disarray due to the pandemic. By the time most hospitals report annual earnings, portfolios will be down meaningfully, LeMaster said. “Coming out of the backside, there’s going to be some pain from all this,” LeMaster said. And otherwise healthy systems may be lacking when it comes to emerging care delivery capabilities like telemedicine, which has seen significant demand during this epidemic, he added. For-profit hospital operators were hit hard at the beginning of the month amid the capital market downturn. On 9 March, Community Health Systems -5%’ share price had sunk 20.7% by market close, while Tenet Healthcare dropped 15.3% and HCA Healthcare dropped 8.3%, Modern Healthcare -1.5% reported. LeMaster noted that all three have made divestitures in recent years in non-core markets, a strategy that may continue as the operators assess their balance sheets in the aftermath of coronavirus. The dislocation will create opportunities for strong for-profit operators, Beith said. “Community and Tenet are still really focused on repositioning portfolios and reducing leverage,” said Beith. “HCA is a disciplined consolidator. I don’t see HCA retrenching from an M&A standpoint - this will be an opportunity for them to make acquisitions.” An expected increase in government funding could also have an effect. On 26 March, the Senate passed an approximately $2 trillion coronavirus response bill designed to accelerate relief across the U.S. economy. About $ 100 billion of that funding is intended to “reimburse… eligible health care providers for health care related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus,” according to the bill’s language. “A lot of moving pieces will impact what happens,” said McClary. “But we can certainly see, as of today, a lot of factors that could drive increased M&A activity (in the space).” $6A5E5F56-7F9A-438A-8EB6-97C7FB7290F1 public.png*4J*https://www.forbes.com/sites/mergermarket/*6 (J*https://www.forbes.com/sites/mergermarket/* * (*V*]JShttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/hospital-ma-deals-dipped-2019*1* $B0130C04-64A6-41DB-9F39-C754F565BEE3 public.jpeg* * (**x(Jlhttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/widespread-covid-19-outbreak-us-would-threaten-hospitals-finances*vJlhttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/widespread-covid-19-outbreak-us-would-threaten-hospitals-finances*x (Jlhttps://www.modernhealthcare.com/hospitals/widespread-covid-19-outbreak-us-would-threaten-hospitals-finances* *0Jhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/for-profit-hospital-operator-m-a-update-8-latest-deals-involving-chs-tenet-and-hca-020819.html* 0* *k!Jahttps://khn.org/news/in-coronavirus-relief-bill-hospitals-poised-to-get-massive-infusion-of-cash/*",2025-09-10T18:51:58.178978,2025-09-10T18:51:58.178992,1

And unfortunately, your actions say to me that they are not important. As a result, I am questioning whether we can remain together as a couple. For a long time, I have been angry about it. But you are being true to who you are. I’ve come to the realization that your thought process and hence your actions in our marriage are more akin to being a roommate/brother than a husband. There is no emotional intimacy between us for some reason. And my attempts to try to figure out what you’re thinking are seen as intrusive, which I have learned to understand- just isn’t your way. You don’t even tell me that you “love me”. However, that lack of intimacy does not work for work bff me. There is no physical intimacy. No unprompted hugs. Certainly, no kisses. And sex, happens only when I initiate it and gets rebuffed more often than I care to say. At nights, you prefer to watch TV more than being intimate. I’ve said in the past that I needed more. And six years later it still hasn’t picked up. Instead, it’s more tv for you to watch or Facebook chats to read each night. Again, it is your nature and it works for you. That it doesn’t for me in an understatement. I know that I have contributed to how things have been working. My attempts to talk about it probably seem like yet another lecture about what I think you are doing wrong. My angry outburst about “small stuff” probably does not help either. I am sorry that it has come out that way. But hey – that’s just me being me. You have a remarkable way to let nothing phase you, which is one of the things about you that I admire most. But I have expected a reaction or a conversation from you on things like this. Unfortunately, those conversations do not happen. We can try to resolve them together. Or, you can qlet things fester because it is too much work for you as you have done with a number of things over the past few years. I hope you chose the former and not the latter because the latter is no longer an option for me.",2025-09-10T18:51:58.239692,2025-09-10T18:51:58.239705,1

They ran an analysis of where planes had been shot up, and came up with this. Obviously the places that needed to be up-armored are the wingtips, the central body, and the elevators. That’s where the planes were all getting shot up. Abraham Wald, a statistician, disagreed. He thought they should better armor the nose area, engines, and mid-body. Which was crazy, of course. That’s not where the planes were getting shot. Except Mr. Wald realized what the others didn’t. The planes were getting shot there too, but they weren’t making it home. What the Navy thought it had done was analyze where aircraft were suffering the most damage. What they had actually done was analyze where aircraft could suffer the most damage without catastrophic failure. All of the places that weren’t hit? Those planes had been shot there and crashed.

It also powers Android apps, so it’s a good choice for those inclined toward mobile development.

If that level of profitability has been maintained for some reasonable period (measured in years), then you have a strong moat. If the size of the positive difference between return on invested capital (ROIC) and OCC is large and if that spread is persistent over time, your moat is relatively strong. Exactly how long the moat must persist to meet this test is an interesting question. If it is not a period of at least two years, you are taking a significant risk.
