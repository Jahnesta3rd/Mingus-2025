My nephew passed away last Sunday due to the disease of addiction in a drunk driving accident.\nBradyn was born and raised on Kauai and just like me, he had a great family and was a very supportive kid. He fell prey to the environment of Kauai where using drugs and alcohol is so acceptable. He was my mini me. \n\nIt has been a struggle and I am now sitting in the devastation and watching what it can do to a family. It is also showing me what would have happened if I died and not chosen a sober life and survived addiction. Not only would I not be here getting to do this work but I see how it can devastate those closest to you. \n\nMy brother and his family asked me to use Bradyn’s life as a catalyst in any way that I can to help more kids on the island and worldwide to be aware of this disease. \nThis is a tragic story but with a strong voice, we can say enough is enough and not let this take one more person from us. \n\nThis Saturday we are going to be doing a workout in Memory of Bradyn to raise awareness and funds for the foundation to continue the work that we do. \n\nYou will help us make a difference. \n\nIt is so appreciated because we can make a difference if every individual in the community and steps up to push back on this epidemic and helps give back to what we are doing. When I say community, it is not only the Kauai community, but you are part of our community as an individual. \nI am so grateful for all you guys have done already to help keep our program alive for these kids. Now more than ever we will push forward and keep this going. \n\nHERE’S HOW YOU CAN HELP\n-Do the workout “Bradyn”\n-Share the workout, with your community for them to follow your actions: live story telling, posting, reposting Keala\n-\nhttps://www.kealafoundation.com/give\n-\n#CrossFitMayhem", "_type": "playlist", "webpage_url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CCuiYwJnT_Y/", "webpage_url_basename": "CCuiYwJnT_Y", "webpage_url_domain": "instagram.com", "extractor": "Instagram", "extractor_key": "Instagram", "playlist_count": 1, "epoch": 1757766731, "_version": {"version": "2025.09.05", "release_git_head": "50136eeeb3767289b236f140b759f23b39b00888", "repository": "yt-dlp/yt-dlp"}}
