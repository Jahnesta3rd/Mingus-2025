# Manual Review System for Instagram Content

This system provides a comprehensive solution for manually reviewing Instagram content that doesn't have direct URLs, such as rich text previews from Mac Notes.

## Overview

The manual review system handles Instagram content that appears as rich text previews like:
> "Black and CULTivated on Instagram: '@gabrielbthatguy killed me with this sketch...'"

Rather than direct URLs like:
> "https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123DEF456/"

## Quick Start

Run the main extraction script:
```bash
python extract_instagram.py
```

If manual review is needed, the system will automatically:
- Generate a CSV file with items needing review
- Create detailed instructions
- Provide a quick reference card

### 2. Complete Manual Review

1. Open the generated CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Read the instructions file for detailed guidance
3. Use the suggested search links to find Instagram URLs
4. Fill in the `resolved_url` and `status` columns
5. Add notes if needed

### 3. Import Resolved CSV

```bash
python import_resolved_csv.py extracted_content/manual_review_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

### 4. Merge with Direct URLs

```bash
python merge_instagram_content.py extracted_content/resolved_content_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json extracted_content/mingus_notes_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
```

## CSV Format

The manual review CSV contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `note_id` | Unique identifier for the note |
| `original_text` | The full text from the original note |
| `account_name` | The Instagram account mentioned in the note |
| `mentioned_users` | Other users mentioned in the note |
| `content_description` | Summary with key details |
| `suggested_search` | Pre-generated search links |
| `category` | Content category (comedy, fashion, etc.) |
| `confidence` | Confidence level of categorization |
| `status` | Review status (pending/resolved/not_found/unresolvable) |
| `resolved_url` | Instagram URL when found |
| `notes` | Additional notes or explanations |

## Status Values

- **`pending`**: Not yet reviewed (default)
- **`resolved`**: Found the correct Instagram URL
- **`not_found`**: Could not find the content
- **`unresolvable`**: Content is private, deleted, or inaccessible

## Search Strategies

### 1. Use Suggested Links
- Start with provided Instagram profile links
- Check the account's recent posts
- Look for posts matching the description

### 2. Hashtag Searches
- Use the hashtag search links provided
- Browse recent posts with relevant hashtags
- Look for posts from the mentioned account

### 3. Google Searches
- Use the Google search links for broader results
- Try different combinations of keywords
- Look for Instagram links in the results

### 4. Instagram Search
- Use Instagram's built-in search function
- Search for the account name directly
- Try searching for key phrases from the description

### 5. Time-Based Searches
- Check recent posts first (last few days)
- Look at posts from the last week if not found
- Check older posts if the content seems older

## Quality Tips

### Accuracy
- Double-check that the URL is correct
- Make sure the post matches the description
- Verify the account name matches
- Check that it's the right content type (post vs reel)

### URL Format
- Instagram URLs should start with `https://www.instagram.com/`
- Posts: `/p/` followed by the post ID
- Reels: `/reel/` followed by the reel ID
- Stories: `/stories/username/story_id`
- TV: `/tv/` followed by the TV ID

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't copy profile URLs instead of post URLs
- Don't copy URLs from other social media platforms
- Don't copy shortened URLs (bit.ly, etc.)
- Don't copy URLs that redirect to Instagram

## Time Estimates

- **Per item**: ~2.5 minutes
- **Per batch**: ~15 minutes (5-6 items)
- **Total time**: Varies based on number of items

### Time-Saving Tips
- Use the suggested search links (saves 30-60 seconds per item)
- Start with the most obvious matches first
- Skip difficult items and come back to them later
- Use keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste
- Keep Instagram open in a separate tab for quick switching

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find the Post
- Try different search terms
- Check if the account name has variations
- Look at older posts (scroll down)
- Check if it's a reel instead of a post
- Try searching for key phrases from the description

### Account Name Doesn't Match
- Check for typos in the original text
- Look for username variations (underscores, dots, etc.)
- The account might have changed its name
- Check if it's a different account with similar content

### Multiple Similar Posts
- Choose the one that best matches the description
- Pick the most recent one if they're very similar
- Add a note explaining your choice
- If unsure, mark as 'not_found' and explain

### Private Accounts
- Mark as 'unresolvable' if you can't see the posts
- Add a note explaining the account is private
- Don't try to guess the content
