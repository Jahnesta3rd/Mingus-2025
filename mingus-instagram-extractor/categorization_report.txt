   • Justin Lienhard on Instagram: "Comment “TRAIN” to access my Training App’s 52 weeks of programming - it’s yours free for 7 days. 

Choosing my top 10 exercises was not an easy decision, trust me. 

First a few caveats. This does not include any plyos, throws, speed drills, sprinting or cardio. That would be a much different top ten. That would even change the weight exercises I listed. 

I chose these not because they were necessarily the best in each category for strength gains, if that were the case I’d pick back squats over zerchers and chin ups over butt unsupported rows etc. 

But these were the lifts that offer the widest variety of benefits and complemented each other the most. I had to made sure some included a balance element, a sequence element, a power element, a core element, a unilateral element, and got every major movement pattern more or less. 

The hardest part was leaving out a vertical pull. If there were 11 I’d include an L sit chin-up. And still we could easily nix → friendships (high)
