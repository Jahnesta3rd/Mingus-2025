## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### UserExperienceService Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def user_experience_service(mock_db_session, mock_audit_service):
    """Create a UserExperienceService instance for testing"""
    from backend.frontend.user_experience import UserExperienceService
    return UserExperienceService(mock_db_session, mock_audit_service)

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def mock_audit_service():
    """Create a mock audit service for testing"""
    audit_service = Mock()
    audit_service.log_event = Mock()
    audit_service.track_user_action = Mock()
    audit_service.record_error = Mock()
    return audit_service
```

### Dataclass Fixes
- Fixed `DataSubjectRequest` in `backend/privacy/privacy_controls.py`
- Fixed `GDPRRequest` in `backend/gdpr/compliance_manager.py`
