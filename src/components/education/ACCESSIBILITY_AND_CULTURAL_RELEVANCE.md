### Accessibility Features in Components

  if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
    event.preventDefault();
    setExpanded((e) => !e);
  }
};

// ARIA labels and screen reader support
<button
  onClick={() => setExpanded((e) => !e)}
  onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
  aria-expanded={expanded}
  aria-controls="career-details"
  tabIndex={0}
>
  {expanded ? "Hide details" : "Tap to expand details"}
</button>

// Progress bar with accessibility
<div 
  className="w-full bg-gray-700 rounded-full h-3"
  role="progressbar"
  aria-valuenow={progress}
  aria-valuemin={0}
  aria-valuemax={100}
  aria-label={`Career confidence score: ${progress} percent`}
>
```

### Cultural Relevance in Content

```tsx
// Empowering language examples
const descriptions = {
  career: "We analyze your industry trends, skill demand, and local job market to give you a clear picture of your career stability.

  }
];
```

### Accessibility Settings Implementation

```tsx
// Accessibility settings interface
interface AccessibilitySettings {
  highContrast: boolean;
  largeText: boolean;
  screenReader: boolean;
  reducedMotion: boolean;
}

// Dynamic CSS variable application
useEffect(() => {
  const root = document.documentElement;
  
  if (accessibility.highContrast) {
    root.style.setProperty('--text-primary', '#ffffff');
    root.style.setProperty('--text-secondary', '#e5e7eb');
    root.style.setProperty('--bg-primary', '#000000');
    root.style.setProperty('--bg-secondary', '#1f2937');
  } else {
    root.style.removeProperty('--text-primary');
    root.style.removeProperty('--text-secondary');
    root.style.removeProperty('--bg-primary');
    root.style.removeProperty('--bg-secondary');
  }

  if (accessibility.largeText) {
    root.style.setProperty('--text-size', '1.2rem');
  } else {
    root.style.removeProperty('--text-size');
  }

  if (accessibility.reducedMotion) {
    root.style.setProperty('--reduced-motion', 'reduce');
  } else {
    root.style.removeProperty('--reduced-motion');
  }
}, [accessibility]);
```
