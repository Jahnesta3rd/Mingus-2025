### Common Issues

#### Performance Issues
```python
def optimize_dashboard_performance():
    """Optimize dashboard performance"""
    config = DashboardConfig(
        cache_enabled=True,
        cache_ttl_seconds=3600,
        max_data_points=1000,
        refresh_interval_seconds=300
    )
    
    dashboard = RevenueDashboard(db, config)
    
    # Monitor performance
    start_time = time.time()
    data = dashboard.get_comprehensive_dashboard()
    end_time = time.time()
    
    print(f"Dashboard generation time: {(end_time - start_time) * 1000:.2f}ms")
```

#### Data Accuracy Issues
```python
def validate_dashboard_data():
    """Validate dashboard data accuracy"""
    dashboard = RevenueDashboard(db, config)
    
    # Validate real-time data
    real_time_data = dashboard.get_real_time_revenue_tracking()
    if real_time_data.get('current_hour_revenue', 0) < 0:
        print("Error: Negative revenue detected")
    
    # Validate growth data
    growth_data = dashboard.get_subscription_growth_trending()
    if growth_data.get('churn_rate', 0) > 100:
        print("Error: Invalid churn rate detected")
```

#### Export Issues
```python
def debug_export_issues():
    """Debug dashboard export issues"""
    dashboard = RevenueDashboard(db, config)
    dashboard_data = dashboard.get_comprehensive_dashboard()
    
    # Test different export formats
    formats = ['json', 'csv', 'pdf']
    for format_type in formats:
        try:
            exported_data = dashboard.export_dashboard_data(dashboard_data, format_type)
            if exported_data:
                print(f"✅ {format_type.upper()} export successful")
            else:
                print(f"❌ {format_type.upper()} export failed")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ {format_type.upper()} export error: {e}")
```
