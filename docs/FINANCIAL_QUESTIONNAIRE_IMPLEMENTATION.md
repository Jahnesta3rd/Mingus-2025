   - Route prefix: `/api/financial`

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates (Required)

**Priority: HIGH**

The current database schema needs to be updated to support questionnaire data:

```sql
-- Add questionnaire fields to user_profile table
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN financial_health_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN financial_health_level VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN questionnaire_completed_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN onboarding_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'detailed';
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN risk_tolerance INTEGER DEFAULT 3;

-- Add questionnaire responses to onboarding_progress table
ALTER TABLE onboarding_progress ADD COLUMN questionnaire_responses JSON;
```

### Phase 2: User Flow Integration (Required)

**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Update Login/Registration Flow**
   ```python
   # In auth routes, after successful login/registration
   if not user.has_completed_onboarding():
       return redirect('/api/onboarding/choice')
   ```

2. **Add Choice Route to Onboarding**
   ```python
   # Already added: /api/onboarding/choice
   # Redirects to questionnaire or detailed setup
   ```

3. **Update Dashboard to Handle Both Types**
   ```python
   # In dashboard routes
   if user.onboarding_type == 'brief':
       # Show simplified dashboard with questionnaire data
       # Provide option to complete detailed setup
   else:
       # Show full dashboard with all features
   ```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Recommended)

**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Questionnaire Analytics**
   - Track completion rates
   - Analyze common financial health issues
   - Generate insights for product improvement

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Allow users to upgrade from brief to detailed
   - Pre-populate detailed forms with questionnaire data
   - Smooth transition between modes

3. **Personalized Content**
   - Dynamic recommendations based on financial health score
   - Targeted educational content
   - Goal-specific action plans

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)

**Priority: LOW**

1. **Questionnaire Variations**
   - Different questionnaires for different life stages
   - Industry-specific assessments
   - Risk tolerance variations

2. **Integration with External Services**
   - Credit score integration
   - Bank account linking for verification
   - Investment platform connections

## Technical Specifications

### Questionnaire Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| monthly_income | number | Yes | Monthly income before taxes |
| monthly_expenses | number | Yes | Total monthly expenses |
| current_savings | number | Yes | Current savings balance |
| total_debt | number | Yes | Total outstanding debt |
| risk_tolerance | range(1-5) | Yes | Investment risk preference |
| financial_goals | array | No | Selected financial goals |

### Financial Health Algorithm

**Score Components (0-100 total):**
- **Savings Rate (25 points)**: 20%+ = 25, 10%+ = 20, 5%+ = 15, 0%+ = 10
- **Emergency Fund (25 points)**: 6x+ = 25, 3x+ = 20, 1x+ = 15, 0.5x+ = 10
- **Debt Management (25 points)**: ≤20% = 25, ≤30% = 20, ≤40% = 15, ≤50% = 10
- **Income Stability (25 points)**: $5k+ = 25, $3.5k+ = 20, $2.5k+ = 15, $1.5k+ = 10

**Health Levels:**
- **80-100**: Excellent (Green)
- **60-79**: Good (Blue)
- **40-59**: Fair (Yellow)
- **0-39**: Needs Improvement (Red)

### Recommendation Categories

1. **Emergency Fund** (High Priority)
2. **Debt Management** (High Priority)
3. **Savings Rate** (Medium Priority)
4. **Investment Strategy** (Medium/Low Priority)
5. **Goal-Specific** (Variable Priority)
6. **Income Optimization** (Medium Priority)
