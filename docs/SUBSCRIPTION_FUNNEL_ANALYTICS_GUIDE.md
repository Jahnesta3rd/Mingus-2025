```python
def analyze_tier_upgrade_downgrade_patterns(self, date: datetime = None, period_days: int = 90) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze tier upgrade and downgrade patterns
    
    - Upgrade paths and conversion rates
    - Common upgrade triggers
    - Time to upgrade analysis
    - Upgrade velocity tracking
    """
```

#### Key Metrics
- **Total Upgrades**: Number of customers who upgraded during the period
- **Upgrade Paths**: Specific tier-to-tier migration patterns
- **Common Triggers**: Most frequent reasons for upgrades
- **Time to Upgrade**: Average time from signup to upgrade
- **Upgrade Velocity**: Rate of upgrade conversions

#### Usage Example
```python
# Analyze tier migration patterns

migration_analysis = analytics.analyze_tier_upgrade_downgrade_patterns(period_days=90)

# Access upgrade patterns
upgrade_patterns = migration_analysis['upgrade_patterns']
print(f"Total Upgrades: {upgrade_patterns['total_upgrades']}")
print(f"Average Time to Upgrade: {upgrade_patterns['average_time_to_upgrade']:.1f} days")

# Analyze upgrade paths
upgrade_paths = upgrade_patterns['upgrade_paths']
for path, data in upgrade_paths.items():
    print(f"Path: {path}")
    print(f"  Count: {data['count']} customers")
    print(f"  Triggers: {', '.join(data['triggers'])}")
    print(f"  Time to Upgrade: {data['time_to_upgrade']} days")

# Common triggers

### Common Issues

#### Data Accuracy Issues
```python
def validate_funnel_data():
    """Validate data quality for funnel analytics"""
    analytics = SubscriptionAnalytics(db, config)
    
    # Check for missing data
    missing_data = analytics._check_missing_data()
    if missing_data:
        print(f"Missing data detected: {missing_data}")
    
    # Check for data consistency
    consistency_issues = analytics._check_data_consistency()
    if consistency_issues:
        print(f"Data consistency issues: {consistency_issues}")
    
    # Check for outliers
    outliers = analytics._detect_outliers()
    if outliers:
        print(f"Outliers detected: {outliers}")
```

#### Performance Issues
```python
def optimize_funnel_performance():
    """Optimize funnel analytics performance"""
    config = AnalyticsConfig(
        cache_results=True,
        cache_ttl_hours=24,
        batch_processing=True,
        batch_size=1000
    )
    
    analytics = SubscriptionAnalytics(db, config)
    
    # Monitor performance
    performance_metrics = analytics._get_performance_metrics()
    print(f"Average query time: {performance_metrics['avg_query_time']}ms")
    print(f"Cache hit rate: {performance_metrics['cache_hit_rate']:.1%}")
    print(f"Memory usage: {performance_metrics['memory_usage']}MB")
```

#### Analysis Accuracy Issues
```python
def debug_funnel_analytics():
    """Debug funnel analytics issues"""
    analytics = SubscriptionAnalytics(db, config)
    
    # Test individual analyses
    try:
        migration_result = analytics.analyze_tier_upgrade_downgrade_patterns()
        print(f"Tier migration analysis: {'Success' if migration_result else 'Failed'}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Tier migration analysis error: {e}")
    
    try:
        payment_result = analytics.analyze_payment_method_success_rates()
        print(f"Payment analysis: {'Success' if payment_result else 'Failed'}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Payment analysis error: {e}")
    
    try:
        geo_result = analytics.analyze_geographic_revenue_distribution()
        print(f"Geographic analysis: {'Success' if geo_result else 'Failed'}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Geographic analysis error: {e}")
    
    try:
        engagement_result = analytics.analyze_user_engagement_correlation_with_retention()
        print(f"Engagement analysis: {'Success' if engagement_result else 'Failed'}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Engagement analysis error: {e}")
```
