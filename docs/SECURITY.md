**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04 19:00:49  
**Security Level**: Production Ready ✅

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Configuration Security
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- ✅ All sensitive data uses environment variables
- ✅ Strong secret key generation
- ✅ Environment file protection in .gitignore

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Flask-Login for session management
- ✅ JWT token validation
- ✅ Secure session cookies
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt

### 3. Data Protection
- ✅ Database encryption at rest
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production
- ✅ Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ Secure API key management

### 4. External Service Security
- ✅ Supabase credentials rotated and secured
- ✅ Stripe payment processing with secure keys
- ✅ Twilio SMS with secure credentials
- ✅ All API keys in environment variables

### 5. Production Security
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

## Environment Variables

### Required Production Variables
```bash
# Core Application

# Database
DATABASE_URL=              # PostgreSQL connection string

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=             # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_KEY=             # Supabase publishable key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY= # Supabase secret key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=      # Supabase JWT secret

# Payment Processing
